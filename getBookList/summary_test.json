[{"title": "Zuleika Dobson", "summary": "\u00a0 Left an orphan, lovely Zuleika Dobson becomes a governess. Because the older brothers of her charges always fall in love with her, however, she loses one position after another. She moves unhappily from job to job until one enamored elder son teaches her a few simple magic tricks. She then becomes an entertainer at children\u2019s parties, where she interests older men if not the children. Before long, she receives an offer to go on the stage, and during a lengthy European stage tour, she crowns success with success. Paris raves over her. Grand dukes ask her to marry them. The pope issues a bull against her. A Russian prince has some of her magic devices, such as the demon egg cup, cast in pure gold. Later, she travels to the United States and is pursued by a fabulous millionaire. Zuleika, however, ignores her admirers. She wants to find a man who is impervious to her charms, feeling that with someone like that she could be happy.\u00a0Between theatrical seasons, Zuleika visits her grandfather, the Warden of Judas College at Oxford, where, as usual, every man who sees her falls in love with her. One night, joining Zuleika and her grandfather at dinner is the wealthy, proud, handsome duke of Dorset. He, too, falls in love with Zuleika at first sight, but his pride and good manners keep him from showing his true feelings. During dinner, he is only casually attentive and on one occasion actually rude. Zuleika is captivated. Thinking that the duke does not love her, she falls in love for the first time in her life. Later that evening, the duke discovers that his shirt studs have turned the same colors as Zuleika\u2019s earrings \u2014 one black, the other pink. Abashed, the duke flees.The next morning, Zuleika pays a visit to his flat, where she is let in by his landlady\u2019s daughter, Katie Batch. When the duke, unable to restrain himself, confesses his love, Zuleika is disappointed. On her arrival, she had envied Katie the chance to be near him; now she can never feel the same toward him again. The Duke is astounded by her strange attitude and tries to induce her to marry him by reciting his titles and listing his estates, houses, and servants. He tells her of the ghosts that haunt his ancestral home and of the mysterious birds that always appear the day before one of his family is to die. His recital fails to impress Zuleika; in fact, she calls him a snob. The Duke is chagrined when he realizes that Zuleika does not want him as a husband. He is cheered, however, by the fact that she expects him to take her to the boat races that afternoon.On their way to the races, the duke and Zuleika meet many people. The men immediately fall in love with Zuleika, and the duke, whose good looks have always attracted attention, passes unnoticed. Piqued by his inability to keep Zuleika to himself, the duke threatens to commit suicide. The idea charms Zuleika; no man has ever killed himself for her. As the duke climbs the railing of the barge, however, she changes her mind. Catching his arm, she begs him to wait until the next day. If he will spend the day with her, she will try to make up her mind and give him an answer to his proposal.The Duke cannot see her that night, for he is to preside at a dinner held by an ancient Oxford club called the Junta, which is so exclusive that for almost two years the duke has been the only member. Each year, he has faithfully nominated and seconded prospective members, only to find each time a blackball in the ballot box. To keep the club from becoming extinct, he has finally voted in two more members. That night, the club is having guests, and the duke does not feel that he can miss the dinner.The Junta was founded by a man named Greddon, whose lovely mistress was named Nellie O\u2019Mora. At each meeting, Nellie is toasted as the most bewitching person who ever lived or ever will. Rising to propose the toast at that night\u2019s dinner, the duke is overcome by confusion. Unwilling to break with tradition or to slight his opinion of Zuleika, he resigns his position as club president. His resignation is a wasted gesture, as neither the other members nor the guests can offer the toast, for they are also in love with Zuleika. The Duke then confesses that he intends to die for her the next day. Not to be outdone and wishing to imitate the duke in all things, the others decide to die with him.Later that night, when the duke meets Zuleika on the street, he is overcome by love and catches her in his arms, saying that he wants to live to be with her. She chides him for breaking his promise. Still later, he returns and stands under her window. She empties a pitcher of water on him, and the drenching convinces the duke that he is no longer bound by his promise.As news of the intended suicides spreads swiftly through the colleges, the other undergraduates also become determined to die for Zuleika. The next morning, the duke tries to dissuade them, particularly his friend Noaks, a rough and unattractive boy whom Zuleika had noticed when she first came to Oxford. To keep his friends from dying, the duke is ready to change his own plans, but then a telegram arrives from his old butler, telling him that the birds had appeared the night before. The Duke is now convinced that he must die. The moment finally comes that afternoon at the boat races. Calling out Zuleika\u2019s name, the duke jumps from the barge into the river. Immediately, hundreds of young men run, jump, fall, and totter into the water, calling her name as they go under.That night, Oxford is empty except for elderly officials and dons. Zuleika hopes that perhaps there is one man who does not love her, that perhaps one young man is left in Oxford. Noaks is still in his room because he had been afraid to die with the others. Zuleika finds him hiding in his room, ashamed, whereupon he becomes engaged to Katie Batch, who before had loved only the duke. Katie embarrasses Zuleika by telling her that the duke died only to keep his ducal promise and not for love of Zuleika, because it was Katie he had really loved. Noaks, humiliated by Zuleika\u2019s charge of cowardice, jumps from the window. The last undergraduate in Oxford has perished.Discouraged because she can find no man insensible to her charms, Zuleika returns to her grandfather\u2019s house. Then, struck by a sudden idea, she orders a special train to take her to Cambridge. Perhaps there will be another chance at another university.", "author": "Max Beerbohm"},
{"title": "Za\u00efre", "summary": "\u00a0 Fatima and Za\u00efre are slaves of Orosmane, sultan of Jerusalem, but their lot is not an unpleasant one. Although Orosmane has the power to treat them as mere chattel and to use them for his pleasure, he treats them with respect and consideration. Nevertheless, Fatima is disturbed to find that Za\u00efre not only is resigned to her fate but also appears actually to enjoy it. When she asks Za\u00efre to explain why she no longer weeps or looks forward to the return of Nerestan, who has gone to France to seek ransom for them, Za\u00efre replies that she finds it difficult to yearn for a mode of life she has never known. Since childhood she has been confined to the sultan\u2019s seraglio under the care of Orosmane, and she has grown fond of her life and even of her master.\u00a0Fatima then reminds Za\u00efre that Nerestan, who conducted himself nobly in the battle of Damas as part of the Christian army fighting against the Turks, had been captured by Orosmane but, because of his courage, was later released on his word to return with ransom for the Christian prisoners, including Fatima and Za\u00efre. Za\u00efre replies that two years have passed since Nerestan\u2019s departure and that perhaps Nerestan made the promise to return with ransom for ten slaves only because there was no other way for him to escape a similar servitude. She admits that she admired Nerestan at the time of his promise, but she has decided to think of the matter no longer. Za\u00efre then confesses to Fatima that Orosmane is her slave \u2014 that he loves her and she loves him. She quickly adds that this love does not mean that she has consented to become his mistress. The truth is that Orosmane\u2019s love for her is so strong and pure that he plans to wed her.Fatima, delighted to hear that Za\u00efre will be elevated from the place of a slave to that of sultana, has but one misgiving \u2014 Za\u00efre is forgetting that she is a Christian. Za\u00efre replies that she does not even know who her parents were; she has only Nerestan\u2019s surmise, because of the cross she has worn since childhood, that she is a Christian. Since she has been a slave from her childhood, it is only natural that her faith reflects the customs of the place where she was reared. With Fatima, Za\u00efre admits, the situation is different; Fatima was captured in adulthood, and she had deliberately embraced Christianity before becoming a slave. Although Za\u00efre regards herself as Muslim, she admits that she is impressed by the Christian faith, but she assures Fatima that her love for Orosmane is so strong that she no longer considers becoming a Christian.Orosmane then enters and expresses his love for Za\u00efre and his intention to marry her. As he professes his love, a servant comes in and announces the arrival of Nerestan, who enters and tells the sultan that he has come with ransom for the prisoners and that he is willing to remain as Orosmane\u2019s slave. The sultan, impressed by Nerestan\u2019s honor, replies that he will release not ten but one hundred prisoners. The only ones who will have to remain are Lusignan, a French nobleman who claims the hereditary right to rule in Jerusalem, and Za\u00efre.Nerestan protests that Orosmane had promised to release the prisoners, and Za\u00efre in particular, if the ransom money were brought from France. Orosmane, however, permits no discussion of his decision. He dismisses Nerestan and orders Za\u00efre to prepare to assume her place as his sultana.After the others have gone, Orosmane remarks to Corasmin, one of his officers, that Nerestan had sighed and fixed his eyes on Za\u00efre. When Corasmin warns his master against jealousy, the sultan replies that he cannot be jealous on Za\u00efre\u2019s account because she is truth itself.Chatillon, a French gentleman released at Orosmane\u2019s command, praises Nerestan for having arranged to free the prisoners, but Nerestan is not gratified by Chatillon\u2019s praise because of Orosmane\u2019s refusal to release Za\u00efre and Lusignan. Chatillon agrees that without Lusignan, the great Christian leader and soldier who fought so valiantly in defense of Caesarea, there is no joy in his own freedom.Nerestan then relates how, as an infant, he had been carried from the smoking ruins of the city of Caesarea to the sultan\u2019s seraglio. Za\u00efre had been a fellow captive. Chatillon tries to encourage Nerestan by suggesting that Za\u00efre might charm Orosmane into releasing Lusignan, but Nerestan knows that Lusignan will not accept liberty under such circumstances.Za\u00efre then enters and tells Nerestan that she regrets not being able to return to France with him, but her love for Orosmane makes that impossible. She assures him that she will use her new status to protect the Christians and to relieve the wretched. As evidence of her intentions, she offers Lusignan\u2019s freedom, granted at her request by the sultan.After Lusignan is released, Nerestan tells him how he had been a slave in Solyma almost from his birth and how he had been able to escape to fight with Louis against the Turks. Lusignan, greeting Chatillon, an old friend who was captured with him at Caesarea, reminds the Christian knight that he, Lusignan, had seen his own wife and two sons die there, and that another son and a daughter had been taken from him. Chatillon remembers that he had baptized the daughter just before the Saracens swept her and her brother away.When Nerestan remarks that he was captured at the age of four, the age of Lusignan\u2019s son when he was taken, and when Lusignan notices that Za\u00efre wears a cross that he had given to his wife as a present, it is revealed that Nerestan and Za\u00efre are Lusignan\u2019s long-lost children. Za\u00efre, deeply moved by the discovery, vows to be a Christian from this moment onward.Believing them to be friends from the time they were slaves together, Orosmane permits Za\u00efre to meet with Nerestan. Unknown to the sultan, however, Za\u00efre\u2019s declaration as a Christian has inspired Nerestan to urge her to give up Orosmane altogether, even after Nerestan learns that Za\u00efre had hoped to wed the Turk. Za\u00efre is torn by emotional conflict; she knows Orosmane\u2019s virtues and loves him as a person, but she cannot tolerate disappointing the hopes and faith of her brother and father, particularly after learning from Nerestan that their father is near death.When Za\u00efre asks Orosmane to defer their nuptials, the sultan is amazed; her excuse, that Lusignan is dying, seems to him insufficient. After Za\u00efre leaves him in tears, Orosmane rages to Corasmin and reveals his fear that he has cause to be jealous of Nerestan. He resolves not to allow himself to be governed and deceived by Za\u00efre.Orosmane confronts Za\u00efre again and tells her that he no longer loves her, but when she weeps and protests her love, he repents. When she leaves him, however, he wonders again about her virtue. When guards intercept a letter sent to Za\u00efre by Nerestan, Orosmane interprets the references to secrecy and to faithfulness as signs of a lover\u2019s passion, and he accepts Corasmin\u2019s suggestion to send the letter on to Za\u00efre in order that they might observe her behavior. In suppressed fury and jealousy he once more confronts Za\u00efre and asks her for the name of his rival. Although she insists that she has no other master, he can no longer believe her.Orosmane has one last faint hope that the romance he suspects is one-sided, instigated by Nerestan, but his slave\u2019s report that Za\u00efre received the letter with trembling and weeping and that she promised to meet Nerestan that night confirms his fear that she loves another. Za\u00efre, trying desperately, in the meantime, to reconcile her duty to her family and Christianity with her love for Orosmane, hopes that he will understand and pity her.Orosmane intercepts Za\u00efre at the place of her meeting with Nerestan and, calling out that she has betrayed him, stabs her to death. When Nerestan arrives and reveals that Za\u00efre was his sister, the Turk is overcome with grief and remorse. After ordering Corasmin to free all the Christians, he kills himself with his dagger. Nerestan, understanding the depth of Orosmane\u2019s remorse and sensing that his love had become perverted by jealousy, laments the sultan\u2019s death.", "author": "Voltaire"},
{"title": "Zadig", "summary": "\u00a0 Zadig, a charming young man with a good education and great wealth, lives in the time of King Moabdar in Babylon. Despite the fact that he is a very sensible young man, or perhaps because of it, he never boasts of his own abilities or tries to find fault in others. He expects that with the advantages he modestly enjoys he will have no difficulty in being happy, but he is mistaken in this belief.\u00a0In rescuing the beautiful S\u00e9mire from kidnappers, Zadig is injured by an arrow in his left eye. The great doctor Hermes predicts that he will lose the eye because wounds in the left eye never heal. When Zadig\u2019s eye does heal, the doctor writes a book proving that it could not have happened. Unfortunately, S\u00e9mire, to whom Zadig has been betrothed, decides that she does not like one-eyed men. In her ignorance of Zadig\u2019s recovery, she marries Orcan, the young nobleman who sent the kidnappers to seize her.Zadig marries Azora, the wisest girl in the city, who takes a frivolous interest in handsome young men. When she scolds a widow for changing the course of a stream in order to escape from her vow to stay by her husband\u2019s tomb as long as the stream flows there, Zadig arranges to have Azora told that he has died. He then has his friend Cador make friendly overtures to Azora and, having done so, complain of a pain in the spleen for which there is but one cure: rubbing the place with the nose of a man who has been dead no more than twenty-four hours. When Azora then goes to the place where Zadig is supposedly buried, he leaps up to keep her from cutting off his nose with a razor. He says that her act proves she is no better than the widow she had criticized. Finally, when living with Azora becomes too difficult, Zadig leaves her.One day the queen\u2019s dog and the king\u2019s horse are lost. Zadig is able to describe the missing animals and their location, but when he then says that he has never seen them, he is imprisoned. He is released after he explains that he was able to tell from marks on the ground what the animals were like, but he has learned a lesson, and when he sees an escaping prisoner, he keeps quiet. Nevertheless, he is fined for looking out his window.A rich and jealous neighbor named Arimaze, who is called \u201cThe Envious,\u201d finds a tablet on which Zadig has written a poem. The tablet is broken in half, and the part of the poem on one piece of the tablet could be read as criticism of the king. Arimaze shows that part of the tablet to the king, but just as Zadig is about to be condemned for insulting the monarch, a parrot drops the other half of the tablet in the king\u2019s lap. Both the king and the queen \u2014 especially the queen \u2014 begin to hold Zadig in high esteem. He is awarded a goblet for having been generous enough to speak well of a minister who had incurred the king\u2019s wrath; such an act is new in the king\u2019s experience, and he values Zadig for it.Zadig becomes prime minister of Babylon and, through his sensible decisions, wins the hearts of the people. He cures a great lord who is too conceited for his own good by having an orchestra and a choir sing his praises all day long, until the lord in desperation calls a halt to the chorus of praise. Zadig also settles a religious dispute that had gone on for fifteen hundred years, concerning the question of whether one should enter the temple of Mithra with the right foot or the left foot; Zadig jumps in with both feet.Zadig is popular with the ladies of Babylon, but he succumbs to a woman\u2019s advances only once and does so without pleasure, for he is too much in love with Queen Astart\u00e9. The wife of Arimaze, enraged because Zadig has rebuffed her, allows her husband to send her garter to the king so that he might be deceived into believing that Zadig and the queen are already lovers. The queen warns Zadig that the king means to kill him, and Zadig escapes to Egypt.After arriving in Egypt, Zadig comes upon an Egyptian beating a woman. When Zadig intervenes, the jealous Egyptian assumes that Zadig is a rival lover, and a fight ensues that ends in the Egyptian\u2019s death. The woman, Missouf, far from being grateful, screams that she wishes Zadig had been killed instead. When four men seize her, Zadig allows her to be taken, not realizing that the four men are couriers from Babylon who have mistaken Missouf for Queen Astart\u00e9, who has also disappeared.Because Zadig has killed a man, the Egyptians condemn him to be a slave, and he is purchased by an Arab merchant named S\u00e9toc. At first the merchant values Zadig\u2019s service more than he does Zadig himself, but he finally comes to see the value of Zadig\u2019s intelligence and common sense. The incident that reveals Zadig\u2019s abilities is one in which Zadig proves a Hebrew guilty of not returning a loan made to him by S\u00e9toc; Zadig pretends that he will bring into court the stone on which the loan had been transacted, whereby he traps the Hebrew into describing the stone, proving that he really is the man to whom the loan had been made.Zadig next convinces an Arabian widow that she should not leap upon the burning funeral pyre of her husband; he does this by making her realize that there are still attractive young men in the world. He settles a dispute among an Egyptian, an Indian, a Chaldean, a Celt, and others concerning the nature of the universe and its operation by pointing out that all the parties admit the existence of a superior being. He is saved from execution by the priests when Almona, the young widow, pretends that she will allow the priests to make love to her if they sign a pardon; they sign the pardon, but when they come to her, they are greeted by judges who condemn them. S\u00e9toc is so impressed by Almona\u2019s cleverness that he marries her.Zadig shows that one can judge an honest man by making candidates for the comptroller\u2019s position engage in a dancing contest. Only one candidate resists the money Zadig has placed in a passageway, and only he dances lightly and with grace, the others being fearful of jostling the money from their pockets. Having performed this service for King Nabussan of Serendib, to whose kingdom Zadig has been sent by S\u00e9toc, Zadig then undertakes to show which of the king\u2019s hundred wives are faithful. Only one resists the temptations of money, youth, and power to which Zadig exposes the women.After settling a revolt of the priests against Nabussan, Zadig, guided as always by the sayings of Zarathustra, sets forth to find news of Queen Astart\u00e9. He meets a happy brigand, Arbogad, who reports that King Moabdar has been killed in an uprising, but the robber has no news of the queen. Zadig also meets an unhappy fisherman who lost his money, his wife, and his house during the revolt in Babylon. Since some of the money owed the fisherman was for cream cheese he had sold to Zadig and Queen Astart\u00e9, Zadig, without revealing his identity, gives the fisherman half the money he has.Next, Zadig meets several women who are hunting for a basilisk that is to be used to cure Ogul, their lord and master. Zadig is overjoyed to find Queen Astart\u00e9 among the women. She informs him that his friend Cador helped her escape from the king, that the king had married Missouf, and that she had frightened the king out of his wits by speaking to him from within a statue in the temple in which she was hidden. The revolt in Babylon resulted from the king\u2019s madness, and he had been killed. Queen Astart\u00e9 was then captured by the prince of Hyrcania and escaped from him only to be captured by the brigand Arbogad, who sold her to Ogul. Zadig cures Ogul by presenting him with a bag and telling him that it contains medicine that will go through his pores only if he punches the bag hard enough \u2014 the resultant exercise cures the lord. Zadig thus manages to free Queen Astart\u00e9 and to win more honor for himself.Returning to Babylon, Zadig enters a jousting tournament and a battle of wits in order to win Queen Astart\u00e9 as his wife. Despite the trickery of Itobad, who steals Zadig\u2019s armor and pretends to be the victor after Zadig has won the tournament, Zadig manages to win both contests \u2014 partly through the encouragement of the angel Jesrad, who is disguised as a hermit \u2014 and he marries Queen Astart\u00e9. As king, Zadig is a just and compassionate ruler under whom Babylon becomes a prosperous and happy empire.", "author": "Voltaire"},
{"title": "Yvain", "summary": "\u00a0 At the season of Pentecost, King Arthur holds his court at Carduel in Wales. After dinner on that feast day, a knight named Calogrenant tells a tale of adventure that is not altogether to his credit, and for which he is mocked by Sir Kay the seneschal. Calogrenant reveals that seven years before he had journeyed beyond the forest of Broceliande. After a night\u2019s lodging in the tower of a courteous vavasor he continued on his way until he encountered a giant seventeen feet tall who was guarding some wild bulls in a clearing. The giant told the knight that if he sought some marvel he was to look for a spring in a mysterious wood, for water from the spring poured on a nearby stone would bring down upon him a storm such as few men had ever seen, with bolts of lightning that would blind him and thunder that would shake the earth. All happened as the giant had foretold, and after the storm had ceased, a knight appeared and challenged Calogrenant to a duel because of the great damage that had been caused by the wind and rain Calogrenant had brought about. The two fought and Calogrenant was overthrown. He tells his companions that he had been so shamed in that encounter that he had never told the story before.\u00a0One of those who listens to his tale is Yvain, a valiant knight, who swears to avenge the shame of Calogrenant, his German cousin. Yvain is then also mocked by Sir Kay. While they speak, King Arthur comes from his chamber, and Queen Guinevere tells him the tale as she has heard it. The king thereupon swears an oath that he must see these wonders for himself; he says that any of his knights who wishes to come may accompany him on the venture. Yvain, thinking that the quest should be his alone, leaves the court secretly and rides on horseback over mountains and through valleys until he comes to the forest of the magic spring. When he pours a basin of water on the stone, a great storm arises. After the storm the strange knight appears, and he and Yvain battle until their lances splinter and their armor has been pierced in many places. At last Yvain deals the enemy a blow that shatters his helmet and splits his skull, but even then the knight does not fall down at once but gallops off on his horse to take refuge in his castle.Yvain, riding in close pursuit of his foe, is trapped when a portcullis falls before him as well as another behind him after he has ridden through the castle gate. There the maid Lunete finds him and saves his life with the gift of a magic ring, which makes him invisible while the nobleman\u2019s vassals search for the knight who gave their lord his mortal wound. While he is thus protected, Yvain sees the Lady Laudine de Landuc, the mistress of the castle, a lady so fair that he falls in love with her on the spot. The maid Lunete, seeing how matters stand, conceals Yvain and ministers to his wounds. Between visits to Yvain, she speaks to her lady, urging her to put aside her anger and grief and to take a new husband who will be master of her domain and defender of the magic spring. Lunete is so cunning in her speech that her lady finally agrees to do as the damsel suggests. Then Yvain is brought from the chamber where he has been hidden. Falling on his knees before the Lady Laudine, he begs forgiveness for killing her lord in fair fight. The lady, impressed by Yvain\u2019s comeliness and bravery, is soon reconciled, and the two are wed with great rejoicing.As he had sworn, King Arthur comes with his knights to see the magic spring, and Sir Kay mocks the absent Yvain, who had sworn to avenge his cousin\u2019s name. Then the king pours a basin of water on the stone, and immediately the rain begins to fall and the wind to blow. When the storm has subsided, Yvain appears, his armor and helmet concealing his identity, to challenge King Arthur\u2019s knights, and Sir Kay begs to be allowed the first encounter. Yvain quickly unhorses the braggart seneschal and then reveals himself to King Arthur and the other knights. All are delighted to find Yvain safe and well. For a week thereafter, Yvain and his lady entertain the royal party with feasting and entertainment of all kinds.At the end of that time, as the king is preparing to depart, Sir Gawain urges Yvain to return to Britain with them and to take part in all tournaments, so that none can say that so brave a knight has grown weak and slothful in marriage. The Lady Laudine agrees, but on the promise that Yvain will return to her in one year. Before he leaves, she gives him a ring set with a stone that will keep its wearer from all harm as long as he keeps his sweetheart in mind.So successful is Yvain in all the tournaments that are held throughout the land that he forgets his promise until the Lady Laudine sends a damsel to denounce him as a hypocrite and liar and to demand the return of the ring. Yvain, overcome by remorse at the thought of losing his lady\u2019s love, goes mad; he begins living like a wild beast in the forest. A hermit living there finds him, naked and distracted, and gives him bread and water; the hermit takes care of Yvain until one day the noble lady of Noroison and her two damsels find the naked man asleep under a tree. The lady and her maids attend the knight and anoint him with a soothing, magic ointment to restore his wits. When he has recovered, Yvain pledges himself to the lady\u2019s support and vows to champion her against Count Alier, who is plundering her lands. So fierce is Yvain\u2019s attack on the marauders that the count yields and gives his oath that he will live in peace from that time on. Afterward, having refused to accept the lady\u2019s hand in marriage or to take her as his mistress, Yvain rides away in search of new adventures.One day, as he is wandering through the wood, he comes upon a lion and a fire-breathing serpent that holds the beast by the tail. Yvain draws his sword and slays the scaly monster, and from that time on the grateful lion becomes the knight\u2019s inseparable companion. At last, Yvain returns to the magic spring where all his adventures began. There he finds the maid Lunete held prisoner in a nearby chapel by order of the Lady Laudine. The damsel is to be burned the next day, and she weeps that she has no one to defend her against charges brought by a wicked seneschal who has persuaded her mistress that the maid acted falsely in the sad affair of the Lady Laudine\u2019s marriage to Yvain. The knight, without revealing himself, promises to act as her champion before he rides away to find lodgings for the night.At last he comes to the castle of Sir Gawain\u2019s brother-in-law, only to learn that the baron is threatened with the death of his four sons, prisoners of a dreaded giant, Harpin of the Mountain, unless the father will give his daughter over to the lewd embraces of the ogre\u2019s lackeys. In spite of the fact that he does not have much time, Yvain rides out and slays the giant, with the help of the lion, because of his friendship with the baron\u2019s kinsman, Sir Gawain. Refusing to give his name, he says that he wishes to be known only as the Knight with the Lion. Then he rides as fast as his horse can carry him to the chapel in the forest, where the pyre on which Lunete is to be burned has already been prepared. Although he has been wounded in his encounter with the giant, Yvain fights the seneschal and his two brothers. Again, with the lion\u2019s help, he is victorious, and the false knights he has slain are burned on the funeral pyre prepared for Lunete. When confronted by the Lady Laudine he again refuses to reveal his identity, so ashamed is he of his inconstancy; he calls himself only the Knight with the Lion. Lunete has recognized him, however, and she accompanies him for some distance when he rides away. She promises to keep his secret, but she declares that she will bring about a reconciliation between him and his lady if it is ever in her power to do so.The disconsolate Yvain departs to seek other adventures, but he is unable to travel far because of the wounds that he and the lion have suffered in their battles with Harpin of the Mountain and the three false knights. At length he comes to a fair castle where the lord\u2019s retainers help him from his horse and attend gently to the lion, which Yvain has been carrying on his shield. There Yvain and the lion stay, attended by maidens skilled in surgery, until both the man and the beast are completely healed. Then they continue on their way.About that same time, the lord of Noire Espine dies, and his older daughter claims the whole of his estates, saying that she will give no share to her sister. When the younger daughter goes to King Arthur\u2019s court to plead her case, she learns that her older sister has been there before her and that Sir Gawain has promised to act as the sister\u2019s champion. Granted forty days in which to find a champion of her own, the maid sets out in search of the famed Knight with the Lion.Along the way she falls ill, but the quest is taken up by a friend whose search brings her at last to the magic spring. When the friend arrives at the spring, Lunete is saying her prayers in the chapel close by; Lunete is able to point out to the traveler the road Yvain had traveled many days before. The maid comes finally to the castle where the knight and the lion were nursed back to health, and, told that they had departed only a short time before, she rides after them as fast as she can. She overtakes the knight and his beast companion, and after she has told her story, Yvain promises to help the younger sister in her need.Before he can act for the maid, however, he is to engage in still another desperate adventure. Toward nightfall, he and the damsel come to the town of Pesme Avanture, where, as they approach the castle, all the people call out to them to turn back. Yvain pays no heed to their warnings. Entering the castle, the knight finds three hundred maidens working at all kinds of embroidery; they are, they tell him, hostages for the king of the Isle of Damsels, the ransom he has paid to escape doing battle with two half-devils born to a mortal woman and an imp. Yvain and the damsel are courteously received by the lord of the castle, however, and that night everything is done in their honor.When Yvain prepares to depart the next morning, the owner of the castle tells him that he cannot go without first fighting the sons of evil. The prize, if he wins, will be the hand of the baron\u2019s beautiful daughter and dominion over all of her father\u2019s lands. Although Yvain tries to refuse the terms of the offer, the lord assures him that no knight who has lodged in the castle can avoid or renounce the battle. The lion is taken away from Yvain and confined, but the beast manages to scratch his way out of the room where he is being held, and he arrives on the scene of the conflict in time to save the sorely wounded Yvain by killing one devil outright and so disconcerting the other that the knight is able to lop off the evil creature\u2019s head.With this victory, Yvain releases the wretched hostages from their imprisonment. Over the protests of the lord of the castle, he renounces the hand of the daughter and rides away with the damsel to the court of King Arthur. The younger sister rejoices when the Knight with the Lion arrives in time to champion her cause against her avaricious sister, who is defended by Sir Gawain. The struggle between the knights lasts all day and into the dusk. By that time both are exhausted, but neither knows the identity of the other until Yvain at last proposes postponement of the contest until the next day. Then Sir Gawain, recognizing his friend\u2019s voice, grants him the victory, while Yvain, in turn, refuses this boon and reverses the decision. King Arthur finally solves the problem by granting them equal prowess in arms and conferring upon the younger sister her rights after the older one incautiously admits her attempt to dispossess her sister.As soon as Yvain is cured of his wounds, he sets out once more for the magic spring, accompanied only by his faithful lion. Again he pours water on the stone and brings down such a storm that the Lady Laudine fears her castle and the town will be washed away. Meanwhile, the damsel Lunete speaks to her mistress in such winning fashion that the lady, losing all the resentment she has held against her husband, promises to restore him to her favor and love. So Yvain and his lady are reconciled after many troubles and trials, to the great happiness of Lunete and all their vassals.", "author": "Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes"},
{"title": "The Years", "summary": "\u00a0 On a blustery April afternoon in 1880, Colonel Abel Pargiter sits at the window of his club looking out over Piccadilly. Everyone in the street seems to have somewhere to go, some end in view. The colonel feels that there is nothing for him. At home, in their shabbily genteel house on Abercorn Terrace, his wife is dying of cancer; he has a family of three sons and four daughters to provide for, he is retired, and he is not rich. He decides to visit his mistress, Mira, who lives in a side street near Westminster Abbey. When he arrives, dusk is already falling; it fills the dingy rooms with the secret, furtive atmosphere of lust.\u00a0In the same dusk, in the house on Abercorn Terrace, Milly and Delia Pargiter are boiling water for tea. Their younger sister Rose is wearing a green-smudged pinafore, and Milly tries to be severe with her in a grown-up fashion. Twelve-year-old, red-haired Martin comes home from school. When the colonel arrives and asks for Eleanor, his oldest daughter, Milly reminds him that it is Eleanor\u2019s day for social service. Eleanor soon appears, dropping her books on the table. During their mother\u2019s illness she has become the family\u2019s mainstay, the keeper of accounts, the soother of hurts, and the arbiter of quarrels. Delia goes to sit with their mother. She resents Mrs. Pargiter\u2019s illness and the ties of sickness and home; in her imagination, she sees herself on the platform at a political meeting with Charles Stewart Parnell, the great Irish leader, beside her. Morris Pargiter, a young barrister, comes home for dinner. The family members are gathered at the table when Crosby, a servant, brings word that Mrs. Pargiter has suffered a relapse. She dies later that same rainy night.Rain also falls in Oxford, where Edward Pargiter, a student, puts aside his work and daydreams of his cousin, Kitty Malone, a don\u2019s daughter with whom he is in love. His friend Hugh Gibbs comes in with talk of horses and women. Another friend, Ashley, appears, but Ashley is jealous of Gibbs, and Edward, unhappy and bored, goes off to bed. Kitty Malone, reading history with eccentric Miss Craddock, admires Jo Robson; he reminds her of a young farmhand who had once kissed her under a rick. Mrs. Malone reads the letter that tells of Mrs. Pargiter\u2019s death and thinks of her cousin as a young girl. She decides that Edward will not do; young Lord Lasswade will make a more suitable match. Mrs. Pargiter is buried on a day of shadows and sunshine.It is cool in England in the autumn of 1891. In the north, Kitty, now Lady Lasswade, shivers as she sits on the terrace with her husband. In Devonshire, Hugh Gibbs tells his wife, Milly, who had been a Pargiter, that the leaves on the trees are still too thick for good hunting. At Oxford, Edward Pargiter, now a don, walks in the crisp air and thinks of poetry. Morris, the lawyer, recalls his childhood as leaves crunch under his feet on the flagstones of the Law Courts. Martin is a soldier in India, and Delia and Rose have left home to lead lives of their own. Only Eleanor remains, tied to her aging father and the house on Abercorn Terrace, keeping accounts, doing social service work, going to the Law Courts with Celia, Morris\u2019s wife, and buying presents for the colonel to give to his nieces Maggie and Sara when he goes to dine with his brother, Sir Digby Pargiter. Sir Digby is in politics; his wife, Eugenie, is pretty and frivolous. The colonel has dinner with Digby and Eugenie on the day that Parnell dies.By midsummer, 1907, Martin is back from India; he is still Captain Pargiter but no longer in the army. Sara Pargiter thinks of her cousins as she lies in bed reading Edward\u2019s translation of Sophocles\u2019 Antigone. Her mother and father have gone out to dinner and have taken Maggie with them; it is Maggie\u2019s first grown-up party. Sara has a crooked back, the result of her having been dropped as a child. She reads Edward\u2019s book and listens to the music coming from a dance down the street. Finally, she falls asleep.A year later, Sir Digby and Eugenie are both dead, and their house has been sold. Colonel Pargiter has suffered a stroke. Sometimes Eleanor, who still looks after him, reflects on what a terrible thing old age is. Sir Digby and his wife were fortunate, she thinks, dying in their prime. Rose is now forty years old and mannish in appearance and behavior. She returns from the north, where she has been attending suffragist meetings. Meeting at the Abercorn Terrace house, she and Martin recall the time they quarreled and Rose cut her wrist with a knife.After their parents\u2019 death, Maggie and Sara go to live in Hymas Place, a crescent of shabby old houses. Maggie and Rose meet in a shop, and Rose joins her cousins for lunch on a day in 1910. Delia has married an Irishman. For a brief time, some of the family \u2014 Eleanor, Martin, Kitty, Rose, and Sara \u2014 come together at a suffragist meeting. That night, while Sara is telling Maggie about the meeting, they hear shouting in the street outside: The king is dead.After her father\u2019s death, Eleanor goes on a holiday in Spain and Greece. She is fifty-five years old, too old to begin a new life. She visits Morris and his wife, Celia, who have two children, North and Peggy. Maggie is married to a Frenchman. The Abercorn Terrace house is sold in 1913, and Crosby goes to live in lodgings in Richmond. She is still loyal to the Pargiters, looking after Martin\u2019s laundry and socks.While returning from his stockbroker\u2019s on a spring day in 1914, Martin runs into Sara at St. Paul\u2019s and takes her out to lunch. They talk about Rose, who has been jailed after breaking windows during a suffragist demonstration. Later, they meet Maggie and her baby in Kensington Gardens. That night, Martin dines with the Lasswades. Sitting beside a young girl at dinner, he suddenly feels that he is old and that his life is empty.The war comes. One night in the winter of 1917, Eleanor goes to dinner with Maggie and her husband, Renny, as well as Nicholas Pomjalovsky, a Pole, and Sara. In the middle of dinner, a German air raid begins. Later, Nicholas tries to explain his hopes for the new world to come after the war. Eleanor feels that here is the man whom she might have married, but Maggie confides that Nicholas loves only other men. Eleanor, Sara, and Nicholas walk across London in the cold darkness. Eleanor has forgotten the air raid and the wail of the sirens.They sirens wail again, and guns boom, on a November day in 1918. As Crosby is waiting in the queue at a grocer\u2019s shop, she hears someone say that the war is over.In 1937, Eleanor, now more than seventy years old and just back from a trip to India, goes to a party given by Delia, a gathering of the Pargiter clan, with her niece Peggy, who is a doctor in a London hospital. Peggy\u2019s brother, North, has sold his farm in Africa; he brings Sara, who had invited him to dinner at her shabby flat. On their way from the theater, Maggie and Renny go with them. Delia is old; Patrick, her Irish husband, is handsome but hard of hearing. Peggy, looking at Delia and Patrick, wonders how people marry and have children. She talks to Martin, who has never been at ease with her; she is his doctor and knows his dread of cancer. Rose comes in; she has grown stout and deaf. Milly waddles beside big, jovial Hugh Gibbs, and North thinks of animals munching in their stalls. Morris, the barrister, is there, as is Edward, the distinguished bachelor-scholar. Kitty Lasswade, now the widow of a governor general, appears in time for supper. Nicholas tries to make a speech, and everyone\u2019s health is drunk. The young look at the old, and the old look at the young. Eleanor wonders if there has been a pattern behind these lives, like a theme or motif in music. Then it is time to go. Eleanor stands at the window and watches a taxi drive up to a nearby house. A young man and young woman get out of the cab, and the young man fits his latchkey to the house\u2019s front door. The sun is shining; it is a bright new day.", "author": "Virginia Woolf"},
{"title": "The Yearling", "summary": "\u00a0 The Baxter family consists of Penny Baxter, his plump wife, Ora, and their son, Jody. They live in a simple cabin in the Florida scrub country, where patient, hardworking Penny ekes out a meager living by farming and hunting. Young Jody still sees life through the eyes of a child and finds a boy\u2019s pleasure in building a flutter mill (a water wheel) at the spring when he should have been hoeing the garden patch.\u00a0One spring morning, the family discovers that Betsy, their black brood sow, has been killed by a bear. Penny recognizes the tracks as those of Old Slewfoot, a giant black bear with one toe missing. Determined to be rid of this offender, he corners the animal in the scrub, but his old gun will not fire, and the bear escapes.Unable to afford a new gun, Penny trades a worthless dog to his neighbors, the Forresters, for a new double-barreled shotgun of fine make. The Forrester family consists of the old parents, six gigantic, lawless boys, and Fodder-Wing, a deformed and disabled boy who is Jody\u2019s best friend. Penny is reluctant to dupe his neighbors, but his very living depends on the destruction of Old Slewfoot. He eases his conscience by telling the Forrester boys truthfully that the dog cannot be trained for hunting. His words convince the suspicious Forresters that the dog is even more valuable than they had thought, and they insist on the trade.After his father\u2019s old gun is repaired, it becomes Jody\u2019s great pride. One day, while hunting with his father, he shoots a buck, and Penny sells the venison at the store in Volusia. Afterward, Penny and Jody go to see Grandma Hutto, at whose house they spend the night. In the morning, everyone is made glad by the unexpected arrival of Oliver Hutto, Grandma\u2019s son, just home from the sea. Later that day, Oliver goes downtown, where he meets Lem Forrester. Both of the men have been courting the same girl, Twink Weatherby. When the two start to fight, all of Lem\u2019s brothers join in against Oliver. Wiry Penny and small Jody also enter the fight with Oliver, because the odds against him are so heavy. Jody is knocked unconscious, and Oliver leaves the fight badly battered. To keep people from talking, Twink leaves town on the riverboat the next morning.A short time later, Penny discovers that his hogs have disappeared. He suspects the Forresters of having trapped them to get revenge for the shotgun deal, and he and Jody start to track the hogs. During the search, a rattlesnake bites Penny on the arm. He saves himself by shooting a doe and applying the animal\u2019s liver to the bite to draw out the poison. Even in the excitement, Jody notices that the doe has a fawn. While Penny staggers homeward, Jody goes to the Forresters to ask them to ride and fetch Doc Wilson.The Forresters, with the exception of Lem, evidently hold no grudge over the trading of the dog and the fight in town, and they do all they can for the Baxters. One of the boys brings Doc Wilson to the Baxters\u2019 cabin, and later the Forresters round up the hogs and return them. Buck Forrester then stays on at the Baxter cabin to help with the work.While Penny is still desperately ill, Jody returns to the place where his father had been bitten, and there he finds the helpless young fawn. He is so eager to have it for his own that his parents allow him to bring it home as a pet. Rations are scarcer than ever at the Baxters\u2019 home during Penny\u2019s illness, but Jody is willing to share his own food and milk with the fawn. Fodder-Wing gives the fawn its name: Flag.In September a great storm comes, destroying most of the Baxter crops. About a month later, Old Slewfoot visits the Baxter land again and kills a fat hog. Penny, who is in bed with chills and fever, is not able to follow the great black bear. Later, wolves kill one of the Baxters\u2019 calves, and, with the Forresters, the Baxters hunt down the whole pack. During the hunt, they find ten bear cubs that have been left motherless by the plague and by hunters. Two of the Forresters take the cubs to Jacksonville and sell them, and Penny and Jody\u2019s share of the profits allows them to buy necessities that will tide the Baxters over for the coming winter.The Baxters plan to spend Christmas in Volusia with Grandma Hutto and to attend the town\u2019s festivities on Christmas Eve, but a few days before Christmas, Old Slewfoot again appears and kills a calf. Penny swears that he will kill the raider, and, after several days of determined hunting, he finds and shoots the huge bear.The Baxters join Grandma Hutto at the Christmas party, and during the evening, Oliver Hutto arrives in town with his wife, Twink. To get revenge, Lem Forrester and his brothers set Grandma Hutto\u2019s house on fire and burn it to the ground. Without Oliver\u2019s knowing that the house was destroyed by the Forresters, Grandma Hutto, Oliver, and Twink leave town the next morning on the riverboat, having decided to go to Boston to live.Back in their cabin, the Baxters settle down to a quiet winter of fishing and hunting. Flag, the fawn, has grown and is now a yearling. The fawn has never been a favorite of Ma Baxter because she begrudges him the food and milk that Jody feeds him and because he is a nuisance around the cabin.In the spring, while Jody is helping his father plant corn, Flag gets into the tobacco field and destroys about half of the young plants. One day, while trying to pull a tree stump out of the ground, Penny suffers a hemorrhage that forces him to spend many days in bed. While he is recovering, Jody has to do all of the farmwork. He watches as the corn they have planted sprouts through the ground. One morning, he finds that Flag has eaten most of the tender green shoots of the corn plants. Mrs. Baxter wants to kill the fawn at once, but Penny suggests that Jody build a fence around the corn to keep Flag out. Jody spends many days replanting the corn and building a high fence around the field, but when the new planting of corn comes up, Flag leaps the high fence with ease and again destroys the green shoots.Her patience exhausted, Mrs. Baxter takes Penny\u2019s gun and shoots the fawn. Her aim is poor, however, and she fails to kill the animal. The unhappy Jody has to shoot his pet again. Jody feels that his parents have betrayed him, and he hates them for it. He leaves the clearing and wanders into the scrub. With the vague idea of running away from home to join the Huttos in Boston, he heads for the river and sets out in Nellie Ginright\u2019s dugout canoe. After several days without food, he is picked up by the river mail-boat. He returns home, ashamed and penitent, no longer interested in the flutter mill, which he now considers only a plaything for children.", "author": "Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"},
{"title": "Wuthering Heights", "summary": "\u00a0 In 1801, Mr. Lockwood becomes a tenant at Thrushcross Grange, an old farm owned by a Mr. Heathcliff of Wuthering Heights. In the early days of his tenancy, he makes two calls on his landlord. On his first visit, he meets Heathcliff, an abrupt, unsocial man who is surrounded by a pack of snarling, barking dogs. When he goes to Wuthering Heights a second time, he meets the other members of the strange household: a rude, unkempt but handsome young man named Hareton Earnshaw and a pretty young woman who is the widow of Heathcliff\u2019s son.\u00a0During his visit, snow begins to fall. It covers the moor paths and makes travel impossible for a stranger in that bleak countryside. Heathcliff refuses to let one of the servants go with him as a guide but says that if he stays the night he can share Hareton\u2019s bed or that of Joseph, a sour, canting old servant. When Mr. Lockwood tries to borrow Joseph\u2019s lantern for the homeward journey, the old fellow sets the dogs on him, to the amusement of Hareton and Heathcliff. The visitor is finally rescued by Zillah, the cook, who hides him in an unused chamber of the house.That night, Mr. Lockwood has a strange dream. Thinking that a branch is rattling against the window, he breaks the glass in his attempt to unhook the casement. As he reaches out to break off the fir branch outside, his fingers close on a small ice-cold hand, and a weeping voice begs to be let in. The unseen presence says that her name is Catherine Linton, and she tries to force a way through the broken casement; Mr. Lockwood screams.Heathcliff appears in a state of great excitement and savagely orders Mr. Lockwood out of the room. Then he throws himself upon the bed by the shattered pane and begs the spirit to come in out of the dark and the storm. The voice is, however, heard no more \u2014 only the hiss of swirling snow and the wailing of a cold wind that blows out the smoking candle.The housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange, Ellen Dean, is able to satisfy part of Mr. Lockwood\u2019s curiosity about the happenings of that night and the strange household at Wuthering Heights, for she lived at Wuthering Heights as a child. Her story of the Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs begins years before, when old Mr. Earnshaw was living at Wuthering Heights with his wife and two children, Hindley and Catherine. Once, on a trip to Liverpool, Mr. Earnshaw found a starving and homeless orphan, a ragged, dirty, urchin, dark as a Gypsy, whom he brought back with him to Wuthering Heights and christened Heathcliff \u2014 a name that was to serve the fourteen-year-old boy as both a given and a surname. Gradually, the orphan began to usurp the affections of Mr. Earnshaw, whose health was failing. Wuthering Heights became riddled with petty jealousies; old Joseph, the servant, augmented the bickering, and Catherine was much too fond of Heathcliff. At last, Hindley was sent away to school. A short time later, Mr. Earnshaw died.When Hindley returned home for his father\u2019s funeral, he brought a wife with him. As the new master of Wuthering Heights, he revenged himself on Heathcliff by treating him like a servant. Catherine became a wild and undisciplined hoyden who continued to be fond of Heathcliff.One night, Catherine and Heathcliff tramped through the moors to Thrushcross Grange, where they spied on their neighbors, the Lintons. Attacked by a watchdog, Catherine was taken into the house and stayed there as a guest for five weeks until she was able to walk again. During that time, she became intimate with the pleasant family of Thrushcross Grange, Mr. and Mrs. Linton and their two children, Edgar and Isabella. Afterward, the Lintons visited frequently at Wuthering Heights. As a result of Hindley\u2019s ill-treatment and the arrogance of Edgar and Isabella, Heathcliff became jealous and morose. He vowed revenge on Hindley, whom he hated with all of his savage nature.The next summer, Hindley\u2019s consumptive wife, Frances, gave birth to a son, Hareton Earnshaw, and shortly thereafter she died. In his grief, Hindley became desperate, ferocious, and degenerate. In the meantime, Catherine and Edgar became sweethearts. The girl confided to Ellen that she really loved Heathcliff, but she felt it would be degrading for her to marry the penniless orphan. Heathcliff, who overheard this conversation, disappeared the same night and did not return for many years. Edgar and Catherine married and lived at Thrushcross Grange with Ellen as their housekeeper. There the pair lived happily until the return of Heathcliff, who was greatly improved in manners and in appearance. He accepted Hindley\u2019s invitation to live at Wuthering Heights, an invitation extended because Hindley found in Heathcliff a companion for card-playing and drinking, and because he hoped to recoup his own dwindling fortune from Heathcliff\u2019s pockets.Isabella began to show a strong attraction to Heathcliff, much to the dismay of Edgar and Catherine. One night, Edgar and Heathcliff had a quarrel. Soon afterward, Heathcliff eloped with Isabella, obviously marrying her only to avenge himself and provoke Edgar. Catherine, an expectant mother, underwent a serious illness. When Isabella and Heathcliff returned to Wuthering Heights, Edgar refused to recognize his sister and forbade Heathcliff to enter his house. Despite this restriction, Heathcliff managed to have a meeting with Catherine. Partly as a result of this meeting, she gave birth to a girl, named Catherine Linton, prematurely; a few hours later, mother Catherine died.Isabella found life with Heathcliff unbearable and she left him, going to London, where a few months later her child, Linton, was born. After Hindley\u2019s death, Heathcliff the guest became the master of Wuthering Heights, for Hindley mortgaged his estate to him. Hareton, the natural heir, was reduced to dependency on his father\u2019s enemy.When Isabella died, twelve years after leaving Heathcliff, her brother took her sickly child to live at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff soon heard of the child\u2019s arrival and demanded that Linton be sent to Wuthering Heights to live with his father. Young Catherine once visited Wuthering Heights and met her cousin Linton. Her father tried to keep her in ignorance about the tenants of the place, but Heathcliff let it be known that he wished the two children to be married. About the time that Edgar Linton became seriously ill, Heathcliff persuaded Cathy to visit her little cousin, who was also in extremely bad health. Upon her arrival, Cathy was imprisoned for five days at Wuthering Heights and forced to marry her sickly cousin Linton before she was allowed to go home to see her father. Although she was able to return to Thrushcross Grange before her father\u2019s death, there was not enough time for Edgar Linton to alter his will. Thus his land and fortune went indirectly to Heathcliff. Weak, sickly Linton Heathcliff died soon after, leaving Cathy a widow and dependent on Heathcliff.Mr. Lockwood went back to London in the spring without seeing Wuthering Heights or its people again. Traveling in the region the next autumn, he had a fancy to revisit Wuthering Heights. There, he found Catherine and Hareton in possession. From Ellen, he heard that Heathcliff died three months earlier, after deliberately starving himself for four days. He was a broken man, still disturbed by memories of the beautiful young Catherine Earnshaw. His death freed Catherine Heathcliff and Hareton from his tyranny, and Catherine was now teaching the ignorant boy to read and improving his rude manners.Mr. Lockwood went to see Heathcliff\u2019s grave. It was next to Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s, on whose other side lay her husband. They lay under their three headstones: Catherine\u2019s in the middle, weather-discolored and half-buried, Edgar\u2019s partly moss-grown, Heathcliff\u2019s still bare. In the surrounding countryside, there was a legend that they slept unquietly after their stormy, passionate lives. Shepherds and travelers at night claimed that they saw Catherine and Heathcliff roaming the dark moors as they did so often many years earlier.", "author": "Emily Bront\u00eb"},
{"title": "The World of the Thibaults", "summary": "\u00a0 Monsieur Thibault is furious when he learns that Jacques lied to him and had run away with young Daniel de Fontanin. The Abb\u00e9 Binot, Jacques\u2019s teacher, has even more disquieting news. From a copybook that fell into the abb\u00e9\u2019s hands, it is apparent that Jacques, not yet fourteen years old, formed an unnatural friendship with Daniel. What is worse, the de Fontanins are Protestants.\u00a0Antoine Thibault, already a doctor, goes to see Madame de Fontanin to learn what he can about Daniel and his friendship with Jacques. Antoine finds her a very attractive, sensible woman, who rejects Antoine\u2019s hints of an improper relationship between the boys. They question Jenny, Daniel\u2019s younger sister, who has a fever. To Antoine\u2019s practiced eye, Jenny is suffering from meningitis. When neither Antoine nor the other doctors can help Jenny, Madame de Fontanin calls in her minister, Pastor Gregory. He effects a miraculous cure of the girl by faith healing.Jacques and Daniel get as far as Marseilles. Although Jacques is the younger of the two boys, he is the moving spirit in the escapade. He is rebelling against the smug respectability of his father and the dull Thibault household. Monsieur Thibault is such an eminent social worker that he has no time to try to understand his own family. The suspicions of the Thibaults, however, are unfounded; Jacques\u2019s feelings for Daniel are no more than a schoolboy crush.When the runaways are returned by the police, Daniel is scolded and forgiven by his mother. Jacques, on the other hand, is put in a reformatory founded by his father. There, the boy\u2019s spirit is nearly broken by brutal guards and solitary confinement. Only by devious means is Antoine able to get his brother away from his father\u2019s stern discipline. He takes a separate flat and has Jacques live with him, assuming responsibility for his younger brother\u2019s upbringing.When J\u00e9rome de Fontanin, Daniel\u2019s father, runs away with No\u00e9mie, a cousin, No\u00e9mie\u2019s daughter, Nicole, comes to live with the de Fontanins. Nicole is very attractive, and Daniel tries to seduce her. Nicole, however, has before her the unhappy example of her mother, and she resists him.Under Antoine\u2019s care, Jacques slowly recovers his mental health. During the summer vacation he is greatly attracted to Jenny. Just as Jenny is beginning to care for him and to overcome her aversion to physical contact, Jacques disappears.For three years the Thibaults think Jacques is dead. Only Gise, an orphan girl reared by the Thibaults, hopes that he is still alive. One day, she receives from England a box of rosebuds like those she sprinkled on Jacques just before his disappearance. Convinced that Jacques is alive, Gise goes to school in England, where she hopes to find him.Antoine follows a different course. By chance, he discovers a Swiss magazine with a story entitled Sorellina or Little Sister. Antoine thinks he recognizes both the Thibault and the de Fontanin families thinly disguised in the story. Disquieted, Antoine hires a detective agency in Geneva to trace the author.Antoine\u2019s own life is quite unhappy. On an emergency case one night, he meets Rachel, an adventuress, and they become lovers. Little by little, Rachel tells him the story of her sordid past, a story that strangely endears her to Antoine.She was once the mistress of the ferocious Hirst, a fifty-year-old man who having incestuous relations with his daughter, Clara. Rachel\u2019s brother married Clara, and they went to Italy on their honeymoon. A few days later, Clara wrote to her father, asking him to join them. After his arrival, the young husband learned the true relationship between father and daughter. To avoid a scandal, Hirst strangled Clara and her husband and threw their bodies into a lake.Rachel says she is through with Hirst. One day, she says she has to make a trip to the Congo to see about some investments. When Antoine does not believe her, she admits that she is going back to Hirst, who sent for her. Antoine sadly accompanies Rachel to Le Havre and helps her embark.According to a report from the detective agency, Jacques is an international socialist and an influential writer in Geneva. Monsieur Thibault develops a serious illness. Fearing that his father will die, Antoine goes to Geneva and asks Jacques to return, but Monsieur Thibault dies without recognizing his errant son. At the funeral, Gise sees Jacques again and realizes that she still loves him. Jacques, however, loses all his affection for her. Jenny is still afraid of Jacques, and in her frigidity she even comes to hate him. Daniel is busy as a successful artist.Jacques feels no ties in Paris and returns to Geneva. He works there during the fateful summer of 1914. Under the leadership of Meynestrel, a group of socialists are involved in trying to unite the workers of England, France, and Germany in an effort to stop the impending war with paralyzing strikes. Jacques is frequently sent on secret missions. One such trip is to Paris just before general mobilization is decreed. By chance, Jacques sees Jenny again. The new Jacques, mature and valuable to the pacifist movement, soon converts Jenny to his views. They fall in love.Madame de Fontanin\u2019s husband dies in Vienna, where he is suspected of embezzlement. In an attempt to clear his name, she goes to Austria despite the imminence of war. While she is gone, Jacques becomes a frequent visitor to the de Fontanin flat. When Madame de Fontanin returns early one morning, she is shocked to find Jacques and Jenny sleeping together.Jenny plans to leave for Geneva with Jacques. At the last moment, however, she decides to remain at home. Jacques is free to leave on his humanitarian mission. He and Meynestrel have their own plan for ending the war.

{"title": "The Women of Trachis", "summary": "\u00a0 Fifteen long months pass since Deianira has received word from Herakles, her husband, who, when he left on his last journey, gave her a tablet setting forth the disposition of his estate and stating that it was decreed that after a year and three moons pass he will either die or live happily thereafter in untroubled peace. The fated day arrives, and Deianira is filled with foreboding.\u00a0Before she can send her son Hyllus to get accurate news of her husband, a messenger, outstripping the herald Lichas, arrives to announce that Herakles is living and will soon appear. Lichas himself follows shortly with a group of captive maidens and, answering Deianira\u2019s question, assures her that her husband, alive and sound of limb, is at that time sacrificing the fruits of his victories to great Zeus in fulfillment of a vow made when he took from towered Oechalia the captive women. Deianira is touched by the plight of the captives. Lichas tells her they are from the city ruled by Eurytus, selected by Herakles as chosen possessions for himself and for the gods. He adds, however, that it is not the taking of the city that delays the hero this long time. He is detained in Lydia. Sold into bondage, he passed a year as servant to Omphale, the barbaric queen. Before this bondage, Eurytus, an old friend, so taunted and incensed him that Herakles, encountering Iphitus, one of Eurytus\u2019s four sons, without warning hurled him from a cliff. This act roused the ire of Olympian Zeus who, because Herakles slew a foe by treachery and not in fair fight, drove him out to be sold as a slave to Omphale. Those who reviled Herakles are conquered, however, and now Lichas brings the virgins by Herakles\u2019 order to Deianira.A strange pity comes over Deianira as she gazes at the captives. One in particular, Iole, holds her attention. Lichas pretends not to know Iole; Iole herself speaks no word, bearing in silence her grief and suffering. The messenger, however, informs Deianira that Lichas did not tell the truth, which is that Herakles for love of Iole destroyed Eurytus, the maiden\u2019s father; that it was not his adventures in Lydia, his serfdom with Omphale, or the death of Iphitus that held him these many moons, but love for this maid. Failing to persuade her father to give up his daughter, Herakles attacked Oechalia, sacked the city, slew Eurytus, and took Iole for his concubine. Deianira, cruelly hurt, calls upon Lichas to tell her everything. He confirms the news. Sorrowfully she asks the herald to wait while she has suitable gifts prepared for Herakles in return for those he sent.Deianira cannot bear the thought of having another share her husband\u2019s affections. Judging it unwise to give way to anger, she thinks of another course. In an old urn she long hid a keepsake of Nessus, the centaur whose work it is to ferry wayfarers across the river Evenus, carrying them in his arms. When Deianira, as a bride, was on her way to Herakles, she, too, was carried across by the centaur, but in midstream he lewdly sought to take her. Her screams brought from the waiting son of Zeus an arrow that pierced the centaur\u2019s lungs. Dying, he told Deianira that as the last to be ferried across the river she should profit by receiving from him a love philter made by taking the curdled gore from his wound. This would act as a charm so that Herakles would never find any other woman fairer than she. Now, recalling these words, Deianira selects a festal robe and smears it with the magic ointment. Then she presents the robe to Lichas, telling him he is to instruct Herakles to put it on immediately, before sun or light strikes it, and stand before the people with it on as he makes his sacrifices to the gods.No sooner does Lichas depart, however, than Deianira feels uneasy because she resorts to magic to win back her husband\u2019s love. Quickly her fears are realized. She faithfully follows the instructions of the centaur by preserving the drug unexposed to light or fire or sun until the moment of application. Secretly, indoors, she spread the unguent on the robe with some wool and, folding the gift, placed it securely in a chest. Now, by chance, she throws the tuft of wool on the flagstones in the blazing sun, whereupon there boils up from it clots of foam as it consumes itself and disappears into nothingness. In consternation Deianira realizes that the black-venomed gore, instead of winning anew her husband\u2019s love, is dying Nessus\u2019s trick to cause his death, and she will be his murderer. Overwhelmed, she determines to end her own life.Hyllus returns. He sees Herakles receive from Lichas the robe and put it on. Then, when the fierce rays of the sun melt the venom with which the deadly garment is coated, it clings to his body, the sweat bursting out, and, before the assembled company, he writhes in dreadful pain. Herakles in his agony calls out to Lichas, who tells him the robe is Deianira\u2019s gift, whereupon the unhappy man seizes the messenger by the foot and dashes out his brains against a rock. When, shouting and shrieking, Herakles calls on Hyllus to carry him away to die where no one might see him, they place him on a ship and bring him to his home.Hyllus now accuses his mother of her vile deed and calls down on her the vengeance of the Erinyes. Silently Deianira goes indoors and in the bedchamber of Herakles bids farewell to her bridal bed. Then with a sword she pierces her heart and dies. Hyllus, told by others that his mother\u2019s gift of the robe to Herakles was instigated by the centaur, realizes too late her innocence, and he grieves to lose in one day both mother and father.Hyllus, still lamenting, leaves, but returns with attendants bearing his father on a litter. Herakles, fighting off the deadly spasms that shake him, entreats his son to end his miserable life. He recalls his great labors and the fact that he never met defeat. Now death comes by a woman\u2019s wile. Hyllus tells him that Deianira was innocent of murderous intent in her act, that she wished only to win back his love, that it was the centaur\u2019s venom that brought about his undoing, and that Deianira, not wishing to live without him, now lies cold and dead.Herakles admits that it was foretold that he would perish not by any living being but by a dweller in the realms of the Dead. The prophecy also promised him release from his toils, but he misinterpreted it as meaning a happy life; instead, it portended death, for with death comes the end of toil.Knowing thus that his death is the will of the gods, Herakles faces it nobly. He bids Hyllus bear him to the peak of Oeta, place him on a great funeral pyre of oak and olive, and ignite it. Hyllus consents to carry his father to his destination and prepare the pyre, but he refuses to light it. Herakles, not pressing him, asks as one other boon that Hyllus take Iole to wife and care for her. Unwillingly, but moved by filial obedience, Hyllus assents. In these dread matters he sees the will of immortal Zeus.", "author": "Translator: "},
{"title": "A Woman\u2019s Life", "summary": "\u00a0 In the spring of 1819, Jeanne Le Perthuis des Vauds and her parents go to live in an old chateau, The Poplars, on the Normandy coast. Baron Simon-Jacques Le Perthuis des Vauds was left a large inheritance, but he so reduces it by his freehandedness that he is eventually forced to reconcile himself for the remainder of his days to a simple country life.\u00a0Jeanne, who spent the preceding five years in a convent, looks forward happily to her new life and dreams of the day when she will find the man who loves her. All her expectations are fulfilled. She finds a beautiful countryside to wander over and the sea to bathe in and to sail on. She meets a neighbor, the handsome young Viscount Julien de Lamare, who comes to call, and they quickly become good friends. When the baron presents his daughter with a boat, he invites the village priest and his acolytes to christen it. To Jeanne, the ceremony seems like a wedding, and under the spell of her illusion, she accepts his proposal when Julien asks her to marry him. The wedding takes place that summer, six weeks after they became engaged.At Jeanne\u2019s wish, the couple journeys to Corsica on their honeymoon. She was romantically in love with her husband before her marriage, but during the two months she is away from home with him her emotion grows into a passion. Thus she is amazed, when they stop in Paris on their way home, to find that Julien is not perfect. She gives him her filled purse, her mother\u2019s present, to look after, and when she requests it back to buy some gifts for her family, he gruffly refuses to dole out more than a hundred francs. Jeanne is afraid to ask for more.When Jeanne and Julien return to The Poplars, Julien takes over the management of the estate. During the long, monotonous days of winter, he begins to wear old clothes and he no longer bothers to shave. He pays little attention to his wife. Having sold the carriage horses to save the cost of their feed, he uses the tenants\u2019 nags and becomes furious when Jeanne and her parents laugh at the ugly team.In January, Jeanne\u2019s parents go to Rouen and leave the young couple alone. It is then that Jeanne becomes completely disillusioned with her husband. One day, the maid, her foster sister Rosalie, has a child. Julien insists that the mother and her illegitimate infant should be sent off immediately, but Jeanne, who is fond of Rosalie, opposes him. A few weeks later, she finds the pair in bed together.The shock is so great that Jeanne can only think of getting away from her husband. Still in her nightclothes, she runs out of the house to the edge of the cliffs that hang over the sea. There Julien finds her and brings her back to the house before she can jump. For several weeks, the young wife is ill as the result of her exposure. When she begins to recover and has an opportunity to convince her parents of her discovery, Rosalie confesses that Julien seduced her on the first day he came to call at the house.The maid and her baby are sent away. Jeanne prefers separation from her husband, but the knowledge that she is pregnant and the priest\u2019s intercession on Julien\u2019s behalf cause her to agree to a reconciliation.Jeanne\u2019s baby is born in July, nearly a year after her marriage. She lavishes all the love that Julien does not accept on the infant Paul. After the baby\u2019s birth, the de Lamares become friendly with their neighbors, the Count and Countess de Fourville. The count is passionately in love with his wife, Gilberte de Fourville, but she rides alone with Julien almost every day. One morning, as Jeanne is walking her horse through the woods where Julien proposed, she finds her husband\u2019s and Gilberte\u2019s horses tied together.Shortly afterward, the baroness dies after an illness that kept her partly crippled for many years. To Jeanne, who was deeply attached to her mother, it comes as a great shock to find that she, too, was not above an affair, documented in the letters she saved.Jeanne keeps the secret of Julien\u2019s latest affair to herself, fearful of the steps the count might take if he ever discovers his wife\u2019s unfaithfulness. The old village priest, Abb\u00e9 Picot, also holds his peace. Unfortunately, Abb\u00e9 Picot is called elsewhere. His successor is not so liberal in his views. Abb\u00e9 Tolbiac is conscious of his parishioners\u2019 morals and is determined to guard them. By chance he discovers the affair between Julien and Gilberte. He has no hesitation about discussing the subject with Jeanne, and when she refuses to desert her husband or to inform the count, he takes the story to Gilberte\u2019s husband. One day, while the couple is in a shepherd\u2019s hut, the count, a powerful giant, pushes the building down an incline and into a ravine. He then dashes home without being seen. Under the wreckage of the hut lie the two mangled bodies.That night, after Julien\u2019s body is carried home, Jeanne has her second child, a stillborn girl. Although she suspects that Julien\u2019s death was not an accident, she remains silent. The memories of her husband\u2019s infidelities fade quickly, leaving her at peace with her recollections of their early life together, as it was on Corsica. Soon even these memories begin to dim, and she turns all of her attention to her son. Paul does not go to school until he is fifteen years old. At home, he is petted and indulged by his mother, grandfather, and a maiden aunt who comes to live at The Poplars after the death of the baroness. When he is finally sent off to Le Havre to school, Jeanne visits him so frequently that the principal begs her to restrict her visits.In Paul\u2019s third year away from home, he stops spending his Sundays with his mother. When a usurer calls on her to collect money for the young man\u2019s debts, Jeanne visits his school and learns that he has not been there for a month. He is living with a mistress and he signs his mother\u2019s name to letters stating that he is ill.After this escapade, Paul is taken home to The Poplars and closely watched. He manages to escape, however, and two days later Jeanne receives a letter from him from London. It is the first of many begging notes he sends her. In addition to asking for money, he announces that the woman he knew in Le Havre is living with him.For more than a year, Paul sends a series of requests for financial help that are never ignored, even though they mean the mortgaging of The Poplars and the two farms that go with the estate. Anxiety over his grandson and his property causes the baron\u2019s death from apoplexy.Soon after the baron\u2019s death, Jeanne\u2019s aunt follows him to the grave. Jeanne would be alone if Rosalie, who was married and widowed, did not return to look after her. Her foster sister insists on working without pay and on putting a much-needed check on Jeanne\u2019s expenditures. It is necessary to sell The Poplars, however, and the two women settle down in a small farmhouse.Although Jeanne is forced to limit the sums she sends Paul, her affection for him does not decrease. When he has been away for seven years, she writes, begging him to come home. Paul\u2019s reply is that before he will return he wants her consent to marry his mistress, with whom he is living in Paris. Jeanne, who is not without a strain of jealousy, decides that she will persuade him to come without the woman. As quickly as possible she sets out for Paris. Although she writes to announce her visit, Paul does not meet her. To avoid his creditors, he moves without leaving a forwarding address. His disconsolate mother returns to Normandy.Some months later, Jeanne hears from her son once more. His wife, whom he married without his mother\u2019s blessing, is dying, and he entreats Jeanne to come for their little daughter. This time, it is Rosalie who goes to Paris. When she returns, she has the infant with her, and she brings the news that Paul will follow her the next day.", "author": "Guy de Maupassant"},

On the day before he leaves to take up his new position, he meets a young woman dressed in white wandering about the outskirts of London. Walter discovers that she knows Limmeridge and once went to school there with Laura Fairlie. The young woman leaves him very suddenly, and soon after a coach comes by whose passenger leans from the window to ask a police officer if he saw a girl in white. The police officer did not, and Walter hesitates to intrude. As the coach leaves, he hears the man say the girl escaped from an asylum.\u00a0Upon his arrival at Limmeridge, Walter meets the first of his two pupils, Marian Halcombe. Marian is homely but intelligent and charming in manner. Her half sister, Laura, is the beauty of the family and heir of Limmeridge House. The two girls are living under the protection of Laura\u2019s uncle, Fairlie, a selfish and fastidious hypochondriac. Walter falls in love with Laura almost at once. After hearing his story about the mysterious woman in white, Marian searches her mother\u2019s letters and discovers that she must be Anne Catherick, a young woman in whom Mrs. Fairlie took great interest because she so greatly resembled Laura.After several months, Marian realizes that Walter is deeply in love with Laura. She advises him to leave, as Laura\u2019s father asked her on his deathbed to marry Sir Percival Glyde. One day, Walter meets the woman in white again. She is in the graveyard cleaning the stone that bears Mrs. Fairlie\u2019s name, and she admits that she hopes to thwart Laura\u2019s coming marriage to Sir Percival. Told of this incident, Marian promises to ask Sir Percival for a full explanation.Walter leaves Limmeridge. When Sir Percival arrives, he explains to Marian that Anne is the daughter of a woman who was in his family\u2019s service in the past and that she is in need of hospital treatment. He says he kept her in an asylum at her mother\u2019s request, and he proves the statement with a letter from Mrs. Catherick. His explanation is accepted, and his marriage to Laura takes place. Walter, heartbroken, goes to Central America as a painter for an archaeological expedition.When Sir Percival and Laura come home from their wedding trip some months later, Marian finds them much changed. Laura is extremely unhappy, and Sir Percival shows his displeasure at having Marian living with them in his house at Blackwater Park. Count Fosco, a huge and self-assured Italian, arrives with his wife, Laura\u2019s aunt, for a visit. Marian soon learns that the count is involved in money matters with Sir Percival. When Laura is asked to sign a document without looking at it, both she and Marian know Sir Percival and Count Fosco are trying to obtain money from her by fraudulent means. Over Sir Percival\u2019s loud protests, Laura refuses to sign the paper unless he will let her read it. The count interferes and makes Sir Percival give up the matter for a time. Marian overhears a conversation between the two men, in which they decide to get loans and wait three months before trying again to persuade Laura to sign away her money. The household becomes one of suspicion and fear.By chance one day, Laura meets the woman in white and learns that there is a secret in Sir Percival\u2019s life involving both Anne and her mother. Before Anne can tell her the secret, Count Fosco appears and frightens the woman away. Sir Percival becomes alarmed when he learns that Anne is in the neighborhood. He locks both Marian and Laura in their rooms, but Marian spies on the two men by climbing to the roof during a pouring rain and overhears a plot to get Laura\u2019s money by killing her. Before she can act on this information, however, Marian catches a fever from the chill of her rain-soaked clothing. She is put to bed, and Laura, too, becomes mysteriously ill.When Laura is better, she is told that Marian went to London. She cannot believe her sister left without saying good-bye and insists on going to London herself. Actually, Marian is moved to another room in the house. When Laura arrives in London, she is met by Count Fosco. She is given drugs, falsely declared insane, dressed in Anne\u2019s old clothes, and taken to the asylum from which Anne escaped. Sir Percival finds Anne in the meantime. Because of her resemblance to Laura, he plans to kill her and bury her as Laura. Anne is already very ill, and when she dies suddenly in London of natural causes, Sir Percival announces that Laura, Lady Glyde, died.After Marian recovers, she is told that her sister is dead. She refuses to believe either the count or Sir Percival. Determined to find Anne, she discovers that the woman in the asylum is really Laura. She arranges Laura\u2019s escape and takes her back to Limmeridge. At Limmeridge, however, Fairlie refuses to recognize the sickly Laura as anyone but Anne. Laura\u2019s memory is so impaired by the experience that she cannot prove her identity. Marian and Laura go to look at the false tomb bearing the name of Lady Glyde. There they meet Walter, recently returned from Central America. He came to pay his respects at Laura\u2019s grave.There is no possibility of returning Laura to her rightful estate as long as her mind is impaired by her terrible experience. While she is recovering, Walter attempts to learn Sir Percival\u2019s secret. He finally discovers that Sir Percival\u2019s father and mother were never legally married. Hoping to destroy the evidence of his birth, Sir Percival attempts to burn an old church record that Walter needs. In the fire he sets, Sir Percival burns up the church and himself as well. After his death, Mrs. Catherick hints that Laura\u2019s father was the father of illegitimate Anne as well. After searching, Walter finds that this must be true.Walter returns to London. Together, the three plan to clear Laura by forcing the count to confess. Walter\u2019s old friend Pesca reveals that Count Fosco is a traitor to the secret society to which both Pesca and the count belong. Through Pesca\u2019s help, Walter is able to frighten the count into giving him a confession and written proof in Sir Percival\u2019s handwriting that Laura was still alive when Anne was buried under the name of Lady Glyde. The count flees England and is killed soon afterward by the secret society he betrayed.Walter, Marian, and a much-improved Laura are happy to have proof of the substitution that was made. Walter and Laura marry and go to Limmeridge to confront Fairlie with the evidence. He is forced to admit Laura\u2019s identity.

{"title": "The Winter\u2019s Tale", "summary": "\u00a0 Polixenes, the king of Bohemia, is the guest of Leontes, the king of Sicilia. The two men were friends since boyhood, and there is much celebrating and joyousness during the visit. At last Polixenes decides that he must return to his home country. Leontes urges him to extend his visit, but Polixenes refuses, saying that he has not seen his young son for a long time. Then Leontes asks Hermione, his wife, to try to persuade Polixenes to remain. When Polixenes finally yields to her pleas, Leontes becomes suspicious and concludes that Hermione and Polixenes must be lovers and that he is cuckolded.\u00a0Leontes is generally of a jealous disposition, and he seeks constant reassurance that his son, Mamillius, is his own offspring. Having now, out of jealousy, misjudged his wife and his old friend, Leontes becomes so angry that he orders Camillo, his chief counselor, to poison Polixenes. All Camillo\u2019s attempts to dissuade Leontes from his scheme only strengthen the jealous man\u2019s feelings of hate. Nothing can persuade the king that Hermione is true to him. Eventually Camillo agrees to poison Polixenes, but only on condition that Leontes return to Hermione with no more distrust.Polixenes notices a change in Leontes\u2019 attitude toward him. When he questions Camillo, the sympathetic lord reveals the plot to poison him. Together, they hastily embark for Bohemia.Upon learning that Polixenes and Camillo fled, Leontes is more than ever convinced that his guest and his wife are guilty of carrying on an affair. He conjectures that Polixenes and Camillo were plotting together all the while and planning his murder. Moreover, he decides that Hermione, who is pregnant, is in all likelihood bearing Polixenes\u2019 child and not his. Publicly he accuses Hermione of adultery and commands that her son be taken from her. She herself is imprisoned. Although his servants protest the order, Leontes is adamant.In prison, Hermione gives birth to a baby girl. Paulina, her attendant, thinks that the sight of the baby girl might cause Leontes to relent, so she carries the child to the palace. Instead of forgiving his wife, Leontes becomes more incensed and demands that the child be put to death. He instructs Antigonus, Paulina\u2019s husband, to take the baby to a far-off desert shore and there abandon it. Although the lord pleads to be released from this cruel command, he is forced to put out to sea for the purpose of leaving the child to perish on some lonely coast.Leontes sends two messengers to consult the Oracle of Delphi to determine Hermione\u2019s guilt. When the men return, Leontes summons his wife and the whole court to hear the verdict. The messengers read a scroll that states that Hermione is innocent, as are Polixenes and Camillo, that Leontes is a tyrant, and that he will live without an heir until that which is lost is found.The king, refusing to believe the oracle, declares its findings false and again accuses Hermione of infidelity. In the middle of his tirade, a servant rushes in to say that young Mamillius died because of sorrow and anxiety over his mother\u2019s plight. On hearing this, Hermione falls into a swoon and is carried to her chambers. Soon afterward, Paulina returns to announce that her mistress is dead. At this news Leontes, who begins to believe the oracle after news of his son\u2019s death, beats his breast with rage at himself. He reproaches himself bitterly for the insane jealousy that led to these unhappy events. In repentance, the king swears that he will have the legend of the deaths of his son and wife engraved on their tombstones and that he himself will do penance thereafter.Meanwhile, Antigonus takes the baby girl to a desert country near the sea. Heartsick at having to abandon her, the old courtier lays a bag of gold and jewels by her with instructions that she should be called Perdita, a name revealed to him in a dream. After he does this, he is attacked and killed by a bear. Later, his ship is wrecked in a storm and all hands are lost. Although no news of the expedition reaches Sicilia, the kind shepherd who finds Perdita also sees the deaths of Antigonus and his men.Sixteen years pass, bringing with them many changes. Leontes is a broken man, grieving alone in his palace. Perdita grows into a beautiful and a charming young woman under the care of the shepherd. She is so lovely that Prince Florizel, the son of Polixenes and heir to the throne of Bohemia, falls madly in love with her.Unaware of the girl\u2019s background, and knowing only that his son is in love with a young shepherdess, Polixenes and Camillo, now his most trusted servant, disguise themselves and visit a sheep-shearing festival, where they see Florizel, dressed as a shepherd, dancing with a lovely young woman. Although he realizes that the shepherdess is of noble bearing, Polixenes in great rage forbids his son to marry her. Florizel thereupon makes secret plans to elope with Perdita to a foreign country. Camillo, pitying the young couple, advises Florizel to embark for Sicilia and to pretend that he is a messenger of goodwill from the king of Bohemia. Camillo supplies the young man with letters of introduction to Leontes. It is part of Camillo\u2019s plan to inform Polixenes of the lovers\u2019 escape and to travel to Sicilia to find them, thus taking advantage of the situation to return home once more.The poor shepherd, frightened by the king\u2019s wrath, decides to tell Polixenes how, years before, he found the baby and a bag of gold and jewels by her side. Fate intervenes, however, and the shepherd is intercepted by the rogue Autolycus and put aboard the ship sailing to Sicilia.Soon Florizel and Perdita arrive in Sicilia, followed by Polixenes and Camillo. When the old shepherd hears how Leontes lost a daughter, he describes the finding of Perdita. Leontes, convinced that Perdita is his own abandoned infant, is joyfully reunited with his daughter. When he hears this, Polixenes immediately gives his consent to the marriage of Florizel and Perdita. The only sorrowful circumstance to mar the happiness of all concerned is the earlier tragic death of Hermione.One day, Paulina asks Leontes to visit a newly erected statue of the dead woman in Hermione\u2019s chapel. Leontes, ever faithful to the memory of his dead wife \u2014 even to the point of promising Paulina never to marry again \u2014 gathers his guests and takes them to view the statue. Standing in the chapel, amazed at the wonderful lifelike quality of the work, they hear strains of soft music. Suddenly the statue descends from its pedestal and is revealed as the living Hermione. She spent the sixteen years in seclusion while awaiting some word of her daughter. The happy family is reunited, and Hermione completely forgives her repentant husband. He and Polixenes are again the best of friends, rejoicing in the happiness of Perdita and Florizel.", "author": "William Shakespeare"},
{"title": "Winesburg, Ohio", "summary": "\u00a0 Young George Willard is the only child of Elizabeth and Tom Willard. His father, a dull, conventional, insensitive man, owns the local hotel. His mother, who was once a popular young belle, has never loved Tom Willard; she married him in the hope that marriage would somehow change her life for the better, because it seemed to her that the young married women of the town were happy and satisfied. Soon after her marriage, however, she realized that she was now caught in the dull life of Winesburg, her dreams turned to drab realities by her life with Tom Willard.\u00a0The only person who has ever understood her is Dr. Reefy. Only in his small, untidy office does she feel free; only there does she achieve some measure of self-expression. Their relationship, doomed from the start, is nevertheless beautiful, a meeting of two lonely and sensitive people. Dr. Reefy, too, has his sorrows. Once, years ago, a young woman, pregnant and unmarried, had come to his office, and shortly afterward he married her. The following spring she died, and from that time on, Dr. Reefy has gone around making little paper pills and stuffing his pockets with them. On the pieces of paper that become the pills, he scribbles his thoughts about the beauty and strangeness of life.Through her son George, Elizabeth Willard hopes to express herself; she sees in him the fulfillment of her own hopes and desires. More than anything, she fears that George will settle down in Winesburg. When she learns that he wants to be a writer, she is glad. Unknown to her husband, she has put away money enough to give her son a start in life, but before she can realize her ambition, she dies. Lying on her bed, she does not seem dead to either George or Dr. Reefy. To both, she is extremely beautiful. To George, she does not seem like his mother at all. To Dr. Reefy, she is the woman he has loved, now the symbol of another lost illusion.Many people of the town seek out George Willard, who works as a reporter for the local newspaper; they tell him of their lives, their compulsions, and their failures. Old Wing Biddlebaum, the berry picker, had been a schoolteacher years before in another town. He had loved the boys who were in his charge, and he was, in fact, one of those few teachers who understand young people. One of his pupils, however, having conceived a strong affection for his teacher, had accused him of homosexuality, and Wing, although innocent, had been driven out of town. In Winesburg, he has become the best berry picker in the region, but always the same hands that earn his livelihood are a source of wonder and fear to him. When George Willard encounters him in the berry field, Wing raises his hands as if to caress the young man, but a wave of horror sweeps over him, and he hurriedly thrusts them into his pockets. To George, also, Wing\u2019s hands seem odd, mysterious.Kate Swift, once George\u2019s teacher, had seen in him a future writer. She had tried to tell him what writing is, what it means. George had not understood exactly, but he had understood that Kate was speaking not as his teacher but as a woman. One night, in her house, she embraces him, for George is now a young man with whom she has fallen in love. On another night, when it seems that all of Winesburg is asleep, she goes to his room, but just as she is on the point of yielding to him, she strikes him and runs away, leaving George lonely and frustrated.Kate lives across the street from the Presbyterian church, and the church\u2019s pastor, the Reverend Curtis Hartman, has learned accidentally that he can see into Kate\u2019s room from his study in the bell tower of the church. Night after night, he looks through the window at Kate in her bed. He wants at first to prove his faith, but his flesh is weak. One night, the same night Kate has fled from George Willard, the pastor sees her enter her room. He watches her as, naked, she throws herself on the bed and furiously pounds the pillows. Then she arises, kneels, and begins to pray. With a cry, he gets up from his chair, sweeps his Bible to the floor, smashes the glass in the window, and dashes out into the darkness. Running to the newspaper office, he bursts in on George. Wild-eyed, his fist dripping blood, he tells the astonished young man that God has appeared to him in the person of a naked woman, that Kate Swift is the instrument of the Almighty, and that he is saved.In addition to Kate Swift, there are other women in George\u2019s life. One is Helen White, the banker\u2019s daughter. One night, George and Helen go out together. At first, they laugh and kiss, but then a strange new maturity overcomes them and keeps them apart. Louise Trunnion, a farm girl, writes to George, saying that she is his if he wants her. After dark, he goes out to the farm, and he and Louise go for a walk. There, in a berry field, George Willard enjoys the love that Helen White has refused him.Like Louise Trunnion, Louise Bentley also wants love. Before coming to live in Winesburg, Louise had lived on a farm, forgotten and unloved by a greedy, fanatical father who had desired a son instead of a daughter. In Winesburg, she lives with the Hardy family while she goes to school. She is a good student, praised by her teachers, but she is resented by the two Hardy girls, who believe that Louise is always showing off. More than anything, she wants someone to love. One day, she sends young John Hardy a note, and a few weeks later, she gives herself to him. When it becomes clear that she is pregnant, Louise and John are married.After their son, David, is born, John reproaches Louise for her cruelty toward the boy. She will not nurse the child, and she ignores him for long periods of time. As she has never really loved her husband, nor has he loved her, the marriage is not a happy one. At last, Louise and John separate; shortly afterward, Louise\u2019s father, Jesse Bentley, takes young David to live with him on the farm.Old Jesse Bentley is convinced that God has manifested himself in his grandchild, that the young David, like the biblical hero, will be a savior, the conqueror of the philistines who own the land Jesse wants for himself. One day the old man takes the boy into the fields with him. Young David has brought along a little lamb, and the grandfather prepares to offer the animal as a sacrifice to the Almighty. The youngster, terrified, strikes his grandfather and runs away, never to return to Winesburg.The time comes when George Willard has to choose between staying in Winesburg and starting out on his career as a writer. Shortly after his mother\u2019s death, George gets up early one morning and walks to the railroad station. There, with the postmistress\u2019s expression of good luck in his ears, he boards the train and leaves Winesburg behind.", "author": "Sherwood Anderson"},
{"title": "Wilhelm Meister\u2019s Travels", "summary": "\u00a0 Wilhelm Meister is traveling on foot with his young son, Felix. As a consequence of his liberation from ordinary desire through the noble Lothario and the abbot, the once-troubled Wilhelm becomes a Renunciant. Under the terms of his pledge, he is to wander for years, never stopping in one place more than three days. His travels are intended to give him a final philosophical polish. Gone are the countinghouse and the stage; he is now undertaking a last purifying sacrifice.\u00a0While Felix plays merrily on the mountainside, Wilhelm muses beside a steep path. Hearing voices, he turns to see his son with a group of children running downhill before a donkey driven by a holy-looking man. The beast carries a sweet-faced woman with a small baby. The adults smile at Wilhelm, but the path is too steep for them to stop. When Wilhelm catches up with the party, the man invites him to visit his household, and his wife amiably seconds the invitation. It is decided that Felix should go on ahead with the family and Wilhelm will follow the next day, after he retrieves his wallet, left high on the mountain.When he arrives, Wilhelm is charmed to find the family living in a restored chapel. He is struck by the fact that the man\u2019s name is Joseph and his wife\u2019s is Mary; they do indeed seem a holy family. When he learns their story, Wilhelm is reverent.Joseph\u2019s father was a rent collector for an absentee landlord. Joseph was promised that if he grew to be a steady man and a competent craftsman, he would succeed his father, but instead he decided to be a woodworker. When he was sufficiently skilled, he began to restore the paneling in the old chapel. His best work was the reworking of an elaborate wood panel depicting the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt.One day, as Joseph was wandering on the trail, he found a beautiful woman weeping beside the path. Her husband was killed by robbers. Joseph, alarmed by the woman\u2019s distress and condition, took her to his home and summoned his mother. Soon the widow delivered a child. After a patient courtship, Joseph married the widow, Mary, and took her to live in the old chapel. Now he is the rent collector in his father\u2019s place and possesses a loving family.While playing, Felix comes upon a box of stones that was given to Joseph by a scientist searching for minerals in that region. He learns that the geologist\u2019s name is Montan, a name frequently used by his old friend Jarno. Wilhelm hopes to overtake the scientist in the course of his own wanderings. He and Felix start out, led by Fitz, a beggar boy who was a playmate for Felix during the stay with the collector and his wife. On the way, they come to a barrier of fallen trees. While their guide is looking for another path, Felix wanders into a nearby cave and there finds a small box, no larger than an octavo volume, rich-looking and decorated with gold. Wilhelm and his son decide to conceal the box among their belongings and to tell no one of its discovery for the time being.A short time later, Fitz leads them to the place where Montan is prospecting. As Wilhelm expected, the scientist is Jarno, whom Wilhelm knew in his acting days, now a Renunciant geologist. They stay with Jarno for three days, while the scientist tries to satisfy Felix\u2019s great curiosity about minerals and their properties.The party leaves Jarno and starts off to survey a natural phenomenon known as the Giant\u2019s Castle. Sending the pack animals around by road, the travelers follow a rugged path until they come in sight of a beautiful garden, separated from them by a yawning chasm. Fitz leads them into an aqueduct that gives entrance to the garden. Suddenly they hear a shot. At the same time, two iron-grated doors begin to close behind them. Fitz springs back and escapes, but Wilhelm and his son are trapped. Several armed men with torches appear, and to them Wilhelm surrenders his only weapon, a knife. He tells his son to have no fear, for there are pious mottoes carved on the walls leading to the castle to which their captors conduct them.After spending the night in a well-appointed room, father and son breakfast with the lively Hersilia and her older, more sedate sister Julietta. Felix is charmed with Hersilia, as is his father. Hersilia gives Wilhelm a romantic manuscript to read. The next day the eccentric uncle of the girls appears and takes them to lunch in a shooting lodge.Finding himself in such agreeable and learned company, Wilhelm exerts himself to please. Hersilia accepts him as one of the family; to show her trust, she gives him a packet of letters to read, which tell of her cousin Lenardo. Some years ago Lenardo determined to set out on his travels. To get the necessary funds, his uncle collected all outstanding debts. While arranging his affairs, he dispossessed a tenant farmer with a beautiful daughter called the Nut-Brown Maid. Although the girl pleaded with Lenardo for mercy, she and her father were evicted. Now Lenardo writes his aunt that he will not come home until he learns what happened to the girl.After reading the letters, Wilhelm takes his son to visit the aunt, a wise woman called Makaria. In her castle Wilhelm meets an astronomer who reveals to him many of the secrets of the stars. Advised by the savant, Wilhelm deposits the box Felix found with an antiquarian until the key can be located.At a distant castle, a major comes to visit his sister. His intention is to consolidate the family fortunes by marrying his son Flavio to his sister\u2019s daughter Hilaria. To his surprise, Hilaria claims to love him. Then the major, after getting a valet to make him look younger, goes to tell Flavio the news. He is heartened to learn that Flavio is in love with a widow.One night, Flavio bursts hysterically into his aunt\u2019s castle. The widow repulsed him when he became too eager in his lovemaking. Flavio soon finds solace in Hilaria\u2019s company. When the major returns, the atmosphere grows tense. The gloom lifts only after Hilaria\u2019s mother writes for advice to Makaria, who advises the widow to tell the major that young Flavio and Hilaria fell in love. Then Hilaria and the pretty widow set out to travel to Italy.In his wanderings, Wilhelm comes upon Lenardo, who begs his aid in learning what became of the Nut-Brown Maid. When Wilhelm agrees to the quest, Felix is put in a school run by wise men who teach the dignity of labor and the beauty of art. Shortly after Wilhelm leaves the school, he is able to send Lenardo word that the girl is now well-off and happy. The wandering nephew then returns to Makaria.With an artist friend, Wilhelm travels among the beautiful Italian lakes. This neighborhood is especially dear to him, for it was the home of his beloved Mignon, his foster daughter. The two men are lucky enough to meet Hilaria and the widow, but the ladies disappear before any serious interests can develop.Hersilia writes to Wilhelm that she is keeping Felix\u2019s box, as the antiquarian went away, and that she also has a key to the chest. Returning to Germany, Wilhelm goes to the school to get Felix. He is pleased to find him a well-grown young man with considerable artistic ability. Father and son, once more together after their long separation, begin to visit their old friends.They discover that Hilaria and Flavio married and that Flavio became a prosperous merchant. Felix is greatly attracted to Hersilia. When he learns that she has both key and box, he persuades her to let him try to open it. The key, however, is magnetic, and the halves come apart when he tries to turn the lock.Felix tries to embrace Hersilia, and the girl pushes him away much harder than she intends. Fearing she does not love him, Felix impetuously dashes away and is injured when he falls on the shore beside a stream. There Wilhelm finds him unconscious. His old training in medicine proves valuable, however, and Wilhelm is able to bleed his son and restore him to consciousness.", "author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"},
{"title": "The Wild Palms", "summary": "\u00a0Old Man. There are two convicts. One is tall, lean, about twenty-five, with long Indian-black hair, who is serving prison time for a botched train robbery. The second convict is short, plump, and almost hairless, like something exposed when one turns over a rock or a log. The second convict is serving 139 years for his participation in a gas station robbery in which the attendant was killed, although probably not by the second convict. Both convicts are doing time at the Mississippi State penal farm, which runs along the Mississippi. The river is flooding over its banks, forcing the evacuation of the prisoners.\u00a0The convicts are moved by truck, train, and boat, and everywhere they are surrounded by National Guard troops and by the muddy water of the rising river. The two convicts are provided with a skiff and told to pick up stranded farmers and their families. The short convict returns to the staging area alone and reports to the authorities that the boat overturned and that the tall convict disappeared beneath the water. The warden decides to list the tall convict as missing and presumed dead while trying to save lives; the tall convict served his time.The tall convict in fact resurfaces. He manages to scramble back into the skiff but is unable to control it. He drifts for some time before he encounters a pregnant woman sitting in a tree. He tries to paddle upstream with her but at night they are swept downstream. They meet others who are stranded by the flood; the others refuse to give food and shelter to the convict and the woman. The convict also encounters some National Guard troops and tries to surrender, but they misunderstand and shoot at him. He flees. Finally, the two find higher ground and struggle ashore. The convict passes out.By the time he revives, the woman has delivered her baby. They get back on the water and are picked up by a riverboat and taken farther south. They are left beside a levee. Taking to the water again, they are befriended by a Cajun, and the convict helps him hunt for alligators. The convict flees again, however, unable to tell the Cajun and the woman that the area is about to be flooded. All three are rescued again and evacuated to safety with other refugees. The convict surrenders himself, dressed in his cleaned prison uniform, to a sheriff\u2019s deputy.A state official and the warden discuss the prisoner\u2019s case. Officially he is dead and therefore free; the young state official is afraid that the administrative mistake will be discovered. The warden points out that the prisoner turned himself in and that he even returned the skiff. To avoid declaring a mistake was made, the prisoner is nevertheless declared to have attempted escape and is given ten additional years to his sentence. The tall prisoner reunites with the short one, and the novel concludes with them talking about women and prison life, especially the tall one\u2019s extra ten years.The Wild Palms. A young man calls on a local doctor to help an ailing woman. The doctor and his wife live next door, and they are intrigued by the couple but know nothing about them. The doctor has been speculating for days about the woman\u2019s condition, which he diagnoses in various ways. Before he is admitted to see her, he overhears the delirious ravings of the woman; during these ravings, she calls the young man a \u201cbloody bungling bastard.\u201dThe young man and the woman are Harry Wilbourne and Charlotte Rittenmeyer. Harry is an intern at New Orleans Hospital. He is an orphan who struggled through medical school on a two-thousand-dollar legacy left him by his doctor father. On the day he meets Charlotte, he turns twenty-seven, and his roommate lends him a suit and drags him to a party in the artist\u2019s quarter. Charlotte is a little older; she is married to Francis \u201cRat\u201d Rittenmeyer and has two daughters. She immediately adopts Harry at the party and insists that he see her home. Harry and Charlotte begin to have lunch together; eventually, they seek out a hotel \u2014 but nothing happens. Soon they talk of escaping New Orleans together; the lack of money, however, prevents them from doing so. Then Harry finds a wallet containing more than a thousand dollars. He debates whether to turn it in, but, instead, they use the money to run away to Chicago. In a strange scene at the train station, Rat gives Harry a Pullman check for three hundred dollars to cover the costs of Charlotte\u2019s return ticket if she decides to come back to him. He also exacts a promise from Charlotte to write on the tenth of every month to let him know that she is all right; otherwise, he will send a detective after her. Finally, in a drawing room on the train, they consummate their love.In Chicago, Charlotte finds an inexpensive apartment with a skylight; she can work at her art while Harry works. At first, Harry has difficulty finding a job, since he did not complete his internship, but he is eventually hired to do syphilis testing at a charity hospital in the Negro tenement district. Charlotte makes figurines which, initially, sell well in local department stores. Harry is fired, however, because Charlotte forgets to write Francis one month, and the detective contacts the hospital. Soon, Charlotte cannot sell her creations; to save money, the couple retreat to a cabin overlooking the lake in Wisconsin.Here they live an idyllic life, swimming, sketching, and making love, until winter arrives, and their food runs out. They move back to the city; they live in a dreary, one-room efficiency apartment; and Charlotte takes a temporary holiday job dressing windows for a local store. When the job becomes permanent, Harry decides that they are becoming too much like a conventional, married couple, the very condition they once escaped. He takes a job as company doctor for a mining operation in the mountains of Utah; in February they leave Chicago.In Utah, it is midwinter, and they are unprepared for the bitter cold and the isolation of the mountains. They meet the mine foreman and his wife, Buck and Billie Buckner, and learn that the operation is about to collapse, that the men have not been paid for months, and that they will not be paid. Forced to live with the foreman and his wife, even sleeping in the same room with them to keep warm, Charlotte and Harry cease having sex. Buck confides to Harry that Billie is pregnant; Buck asks him to abort the fetus. At first, Harry refuses, but he finally does perform the operation. Soon after, the Buckners leave, and Harry assumes the role of overseer of the mine. He then realizes that the situation is futile, and he informs the miners, sending them off with the contents of the company store. Charlotte and Harry take the mining train out of the mountains; they go to San Antonio, Texas. Charlotte confides in Harry that she is pregnant, too, the result of a period of passion following the weeks of abstinence. At first, Harry tries to find medicine to induce the abortion, but when that proves ineffective, he reluctantly performs it himself. Charlotte is rejected by her daughters during an attempted meeting with them back in New Orleans. Charlotte, who knows that she is ill from the abortion, makes Francis promise not to prosecute Harry if she should die.Back on the Mississippi Gulf coast, Charlotte is dying of a botched abortion. The doctor agrees to call an ambulance to take Charlotte to the hospital, but he admits that she is going to die. He also insists on calling the police to arrest Harry, and they take Harry to the hospital where Charlotte dies. Harry is then taken to jail to await the legal proceedings. He is tried and convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to fifty years at hard labor. True to his promise, Rat tries to help Harry, but the judge refuses to be lenient. Rat makes one last attempt to help Harry by smuggling him a cyanide capsule to save himself the fifty years at hard labor. Harry refuses.The end of the novel focuses on Harry\u2019s musings about his life as he gazes out his cell window. He notices a woman hanging out her washing on the deck of an abandoned ship in the harbor. That domestic scene reminds him of the time he and Charlotte spent together. A palm tree rustling in the wind makes a dry, wild sound that fills Harry\u2019s cell. Harry decides to remain alive to keep the memory of Charlotte and their time together alive; this thought gives him the courage to face his long hard time. Between grief and nothing, Harry muses, I will take grief.", "author": "William Faulkner"},
{"title": "The Wild Ass\u2019s Skin", "summary": "\u00a0 In a poor quarter of Paris, Raphael de Valentin walks hesitantly into a gaming room. Inside are the usual raffish hoodlums. To them, the young man appears marked for mischance. Raphael plays his last coin on a turn of the wheel and loses.\u00a0Resolved to commit suicide, he wanders to the Seine. For a time, he leans over the parapet of the Pont Royal and looks at the cold water below. Only the thought of the paid rescuers keeps him from jumping. He finally seeks shelter in an antique shop, where he poses as a customer. The proprietor, a wizened old man, takes him upstairs and shows him a piece of shagreen, or untanned animal skin, on which are engraved words in Sanskrit telling the power of the skin. The possessor of the skin will get anything he or she wishes for, but, in return, the wisher\u2019s life will belong to the talisman, and he or she will die when the skin, shrinking with each wish, dwindles to nothingness.Despite the antique dealer\u2019s warning, Raphael recklessly takes the piece of skin and wishes for a great banquet furnished with much wine, carousing companions, and ladies of light virtue. As he leaves the shop, he meets his friends Rastignac and \u00c9mile, two penniless adventurers. They have a great scheme in mind for him \u2014 he is to be the editor of a new periodical backed by a rich banker. To celebrate the appointment, the banker is giving a banquet in Raphael\u2019s honor that very evening. Disquieted only a little by the prompt and complete granting of his wish, Raphael goes willingly enough to the banquet.A rich table is laid in the banker\u2019s apartment. After eating and drinking far too much, the company of men withdraw to another room, where a group of joyous ladies are waiting for them. In his somewhat drunken state, Raphael thinks that the women all look pure and beautiful. Settling himself with two complaisant entertainers and \u00c9mile, Raphael decides to tell them the story of how he has come to be where he is.After his mother\u2019s death, his rather stern father did his best to train his son for a scholarly career. The boy was destined to be a lawyer, and to that end he read law diligently. Shortly before he was to take a law degree, however, his father died. Instead of leaving the son financially secure, the estate amounted to only a few francs. Thinking to achieve a fortune, Raphael decided to shut himself up in a garret and produce literary works of genius. He found that by living strictly on cold meat, bread, and milk, he would have enough money for a while.He found a cheap room under the eaves of a modest house and settled into his laborious routine of writing. Soon, he had begun his projects. He spent half of his time writing a comedy, and the rest of his efforts went into the composition of a discourse on the human will. The family from whom he rented his room consisted of a mother, Madame Gaudin, and her young daughter, Pauline. The father, an army captain, had been lost in Siberia; only his wife believed him still alive. Pauline was an attractive child. Raphael gave her piano lessons, and Pauline performed small household chores for him in return.For a long time, Raphael stuck to his spartan schedule, but at last the poor diet and the effort of intense concentration proved too much for him to endure. He went out for a short walk one day and ran into Rastignac, who teased him about the way he lived. Rastignac had no money and many bills, yet he lived a life of luxury. Resourceful at finding jobs, he secured a hack writing commission for Raphael. The advance payment was enough to settle Raphael\u2019s debts and to leave a little extra money.After faithfully paying his account with Pauline\u2019s mother, Raphael took his remaining capital to Rastignac, who was to gamble with it. Fortunately, Rastignac won a large sum. Raphael bought new clothes before Rastignac took him to see the Countess Foedora, who entertained lavishly. Since he was a well-educated man, Raphael was soon a favorite at Foedora\u2019s salons, and by hook or crook he managed to keep up appearances so as to stay in her circle of close friends. He even took Foedora driving when he had the money. Pauline, ever the faithful friend, occasionally gave him small sums to see him through the times when he had little money.Foedora was a woman of mystery. She was a young widow, wealthy and surrounded by admirers. Some dark secret in her past, however, kept her from marrying again or even taking a lover. Although she had many male friends, she had no inclination for a serious affair. She finally explained her attitude very clearly to Raphael, who was very disappointed.Determined to win his lady, he hid behind her bed one evening and waited while Foedora prepared herself for sleep. From this close observation, Raphael romantically expected to learn how to break down her reserve. The effort, however, was in vain. Convinced at last that he could not win Foedora, Raphael gave up his social life; not even Pauline could console him. Without funds and with no prospects, he began to think of suicide.As he finishes telling this story, Raphael notices that \u00c9mile and the women are not seriously interested; \u00c9mile even jokes about his trials and discomfiture. Soon everyone in the company falls into drunken sleep. When they all awake, Raphael is disgusted at the tawdry appearance of his fellow rioters. Going back to the banquet table, he tells of his piece of skin and, in a spirit of bravado, wishes for six million francs. Before he leaves the table, a messenger arrives to announce the death of Raphael\u2019s mother\u2019s brother; the dead man has bequeathed his nephew six million francs. Even though he is elated by his good fortune, Raphael is disturbed to see that the magic skin is growing smaller.Riches bring no peace to Raphael. Although he now lives in greatest luxury, he also lives in fear. He constantly has to guard against any desires, as even inadvertent wishes shrink the magic skin.One night at the opera, he sees Foedora again. Leaning aside so that she will not see him, he brushes against his neighbor. As he turns to apologize, he discovers that the woman beside him is Pauline Gaudin. She is now wealthy, for her father has returned with a fortune. Raphael and Pauline are soon married, and for a few weeks Raphael knows a little happiness.Because the skin continues to shrink steadily, Raphael decides to take stern measures. He shows the skin to a zoologist, who informs him that it is a piece of skin from a rare, wild Persian ass. Then he visits a mechanic and has him try to stretch the skin in a press, but to no avail. Even in a white hot forge, the skin remains cool and pliable. A chemist tries immersing the wild ass\u2019s skin in hydrofluoric acid, but the skin will still not stretch.With his health failing fast, Raphael leaves his bride to seek safety in the mountains. The change of air does him no good, however, and his condition grows steadily worse. One day a braggart challenges him to a duel. Raphael accepts, knowing bitterly that his unspoken wish will make him the victor. After shooting his opponent in the heart, he flees back to Paris with his magic skin, which is now no larger than an oak leaf.Although Raphael consults the best doctors available, they give him no comfort or help.

{"title": "Wieland", "summary": "\u00a0 In a long letter to a friend, Clara Wieland tells the story of the tragedy of her family. Her father was something of a religious fanatic, a strange man who feared some dreadful punishment because he did not answer a call to the mission field. He became more and more depressed and withdrawn until his life ended in a horrible fashion. One night, he visited a temple he built for solitary meditation. His wife, fearing the appearance and manner of her husband, followed him and saw his clothing suddenly go up in flames. She found him insensible, muttering incoherently about having been struck down by an unseen hand. Soon afterward, he died. Within a few months, the mother followed her husband to the grave, leaving Clara and her brother orphaned but wealthy. They were happily reared by an aunt who gave them love and comfort and a good education.\u00a0One of their companions was Catharine Pleyel, a rich and beautiful girl with whom Theodore Wieland fell in love when he reached young manhood. Catharine returned his love, and when Wieland came of age they were married. Wieland took possession of the family house and half of the fortune, Clara the other half of their inheritance. Since she and Catharine and Wieland were beloved friends as well as relatives, Clara took a house only a short distance from her brother and sister-in-law. The three spent much time together. Clara and Catharine were frank and cheerful, but Wieland was more somber and thoughtful in disposition. He was, however, always considerate of their happiness and nobly devoted his life to it. His melancholy was not morbid, only sober. The temple in which their father met his strange fate was used by the three as a setting for long and delightful conversations, although Wieland\u2019s talk dwelt too often on death to suit Clara and Catharine. Their circle was soon augmented by the addition of Catharine\u2019s beloved brother Henry, who was for some time in Europe. His boisterous mirth enlivened the little group. Henry and Wieland found one great difference in their beliefs: Wieland built his life on religious necessity, Henry, on intellectual liberty. Their fondness for each other, however, allowed them to differ without altering their mutual affection.Wieland\u2019s family was enlarged during the next six years by four natural children and a foster child whose mother died. About that time, another strange occurrence took place in the Wieland family. One day, Wieland went to the temple to pick up a letter that would settle a minor dispute. Before he reached the temple, he was stopped by his wife\u2019s voice, telling him that danger lay in his path. Returning quickly to the house, he found his wife there. Clara and Henry verified her statement that she did not leave the room. Although the others soon dismissed the incident from their minds, it preyed on the already melancholy Wieland to the exclusion of everything else.Not long after that incident, Henry learned that Wieland inherited some large estates in Europe, and he wanted Wieland to go abroad to claim them. Henry would accompany his friend because he had left his heart with a baroness, now widowed and willing to accept his suit. When Wieland seemed reluctant to make the journey, Henry, in an effort to persuade him, asked him one night to go for a walk. Their walk was interrupted by a voice telling them that the baroness was dead. Again, the voice was Catharine\u2019s, but again Catharine was nowhere near the men when the voice was heard. More frightening was the verification of the baroness\u2019s death given to Henry a few days later. Some dread supernatural power, Wieland believed, spoke to them.Shortly after these mysterious occurrences, a stranger appeared in the neighborhood. He was dressed like a clown or a pathetically humorous beggar, but his voice had the musical ring of an actor. Clara, who saw him before the others knew of his existence, was strangely drawn to him. She forgot him, however, because of another frightening incident. One night, alone in her room, she heard two voices in the closet planning her murder. One voice advised shooting, the other, choking. She fled to her brother\u2019s house and fell at his door in a faint. Wieland and Henry came to her rescue in answer to a summons from an unknown source, a voice calling that a loved one lay dying at the door.Henry insisted upon occupying a vacant apartment in Clara\u2019s home to protect her from her unknown enemies. Clara was beset with nightmares, the mystifying voice warning her of danger from her brother. Soon after the affair of the voices in the closet, she met the stranger she had seen and to whom she was unaccountably drawn. His name was Carwin, and he had known Henry in Spain. His intelligent conversation and his wide travels made him welcome in the little group, and he joined them frequently. When they discussed the supernatural voices they all heard, Carwin dismissed the voices as fancy or pranks.Clara, beginning to feel herself in love with Henry, believed that he returned her love but feared to tell her of it because he did not know her feelings. Then he confronted her with the accusation that she was a wanton. He said that he heard her and a lover, Carwin, talking and that her words made her a sinner and a fallen woman. Henry also learned that Carwin was wanted for murder, and he heaped abuses on the innocent Clara for consorting with such a man. All of her pleas of innocence went unheeded, and she was thrown into despair. Thinking that Carwin set out to ruin her, she was enraged when she received a note in which he asked for an interview. Reluctantly, she agreed to meet him and hear his story. He was to come to her home, but when she arrived there she found only a note warning her of a horrible sight awaiting her. In her room, she found Catharine on the bed, murdered.Wieland entered her room, his manner strange and exulted, and begged that this sacrifice not be demanded of him. Before he reached Clara, however, others came into the house. From them she learned that her brother\u2019s children were also dead, killed by the same hand that murdered their mother.Clara was taken by friends to the city. There, after a time, she learned the tragic story. The murderer was Wieland, his hand guided, he said, by a voice from heaven demanding that he sacrifice his loved ones to God. He felt no guilt, only glory at having been the instrument through whom God worked. Twice Wieland broke out of prison, his belief being that he must also kill Clara and Henry. Clara suspected that Carwin somehow influenced Wieland to kill.Carwin went to Clara and protested his innocence. He admitted that his was the other voices heard. He was a ventriloquist who used his tricks either to play some prank or to escape detection while prying into other people\u2019s affairs. Clara refused to believe him. While they talked, Wieland entered the apartment. Prepared to kill Clara, he again broke out of prison to fulfill his bloody destiny. This time Carwin, using his skill to save Clara, called out to Wieland that no voice told him to kill, that only his own lunatic brain guided him. At his words, Wieland regained his sanity and seemed to understand for the first time what he did. Picking up a knife, he plunged it into his throat.Three years passed before Clara knew peace. Her uncle cared for her and arranged a meeting between Carwin and Henry so that Carwin might confess his part in the defamation of Clara\u2019s character. Carwin was jealous and thus tried to destroy Henry\u2019s affection for her. Henry also learned that his baroness was not dead; the report was another of Carwin\u2019s tricks. Henry married the baroness and settled down near Boston. Carwin, not a murderer but the victim of a plot, escaped to the country and became a farmer. Henry\u2019s wife died soon after their marriage, and he and Clara renewed their love. Their later happiness was marred only by sad and tragic memories.", "author": "Charles Brockden Brown"},
{"title": "Westward Ho!", "summary": "\u00a0 Amyas Leigh has a secret longing to go to sea, but he never speaks of it because he knows his parents think him too young for such a rough, hard life. When he meets John Oxenham and Salvation Yeo, who are recruiting a crew to sail to the New World after Spanish treasure, he begs to be allowed to join them, but his parents and Sir Richard Grenvile, his godfather, persuade him to wait a while. The next year, his father dies of fever, and his brother Frank goes to the court of Queen Elizabeth. Then Sir Richard persuades Amyas\u2019s mother to let the boy accompany Sir Francis Drake on the first English voyage around the world. Finally, Drake and his adventurers return, and Amyas, no longer a boy but a blond young giant, comes back to his home at Bideford, in Devon.\u00a0He remembers one face in the village better than any other: Rose Salterne, the mayor\u2019s daughter. All the young men love and honor her, including Amyas and his brother Frank, who returns from court. She is also loved by Eustace Leigh, the cousin of Amyas and Frank. Eustace is a Catholic. His cousins distrust him because they suspect he is in league with the Jesuit priests. When Rose spurns his love, he vows revenge. The other young men who love Rose form the Brotherhood of the Rose, and all swear to protect her always and to remain friends, no matter who should win her.Shortly after Amyas returns from his voyage with Drake, Yeo comes to him and Sir Richard with a strange and horrible tale. The voyage that he made with Oxenham was ill-fated, and Oxenham and most of the crew were captured by the Spanish Inquisition. Oxenham had a child by a Spanish lady, and before they were separated, Yeo vowed that he would protect the child. Yeo did his best, but the child was lost, and now Yeo begs that he might attach himself to Amyas and go wherever Amyas goes. In his travels, he thinks that he might someday find the little maid again. Amyas and Sir Richard are touched by the story, and Amyas promises to keep Yeo with him. Before long, the two sail with Sir Walter Raleigh for Ireland, where they will fight the Spaniards.In Ireland, Raleigh defeats the Spaniards, and Amyas takes Don Guzman de Soto, a Spanish nobleman, as hostage. Don Guzman accompanies him back to Bideford, to wait for his ransom from Spain. Don Guzman is a charming gentleman, and it is not long before he catches the eye of Rose. After his ransom is paid, he leaves England; then it is learned that Rose also disappeared in the company of Lucy the witch. Her father, Amyas, Frank, and the other young men of the Brotherhood of the Rose are wild with grief. All vow to sail to La Guayra in Caracas, where Don Guzman went to be governor and where they feel Rose fled to join him.Their voyage is an eventful one. When they near La Guayra, they are seen by the Spaniards, and they fight many times before they reach the shore. Amyas and Frank go ashore with a few men to try to rescue Rose. There they learn that Eustace knew of their voyage and beat them to their destination to warn Don Guzman of their approach. Frank and Amyas hear Rose tell Eustace that she is happily married to Don Guzman, so they know she will never leave with them. Nevertheless, they also hear Eustace beg her to run away with him, threatening to turn her over to the Inquisition if she refuses. At that threat, Frank and Amyas attack Eustace, but he escapes and is never heard of again. Rose flees into the fort. As they make their way back to their ship, Frank is captured by Don Guzman\u2019s men. Amyas is knocked unconscious, but his men carry him back to the ship.When the ship is damaged in a later encounter with the Spaniards, the crew beaches her and begins a march toward the fabled city of Manoa. It is a long and hazardous journey over high mountains and through a land of hostile Indians. They find no El Dorado, but a young priest of one of the tribes falls in love with Amyas and follows him the rest of the journey. She is called Ayacanora, and, although she is of an Indian tribe, she seems to have the look of a white woman.After more than three years, the little band reaches the shore of New Granada. There, after a furious fight, they capture a Spanish galleon. After they secure her and set sail, they go into the hold and release the prisoners the Spaniards have aboard. One of them is Lucy the witch, who tells them of the horrible fate of Rose and Frank. Before Eustace disappeared from La Guayra, he reported to the Inquisition that Rose kept her Protestant faith. She and Lucy were taken before the terrible tribunal, where Frank was also turned over to the torturers. Lucy confessed that she accepted the Catholic faith, but Frank and Rose, refusing to yield to the Inquisitors, were tortured for many days before they were burned at the stake. When Amyas hears this story, he is like a madman, vowing never to rest until he kills every Spaniard he sees. Two Spanish dignitaries on the ship witnessed the burning of Frank and Rose, and Amyas has them hanged immediately.At last, the ship reaches Devon, and Amyas takes Ayacanora to his home, where his mother welcomes her and treats her as a daughter. During the voyage, Yeo discovers that she is the little maid he promised Oxenham to protect, and he becomes a father to her. Amyas treats her as he might a sister, but Ayacanora is not happy at this treatment.After a time, Amyas fits out a ship and prepares to go with Drake to Virginia, but before they sail, the Spanish Armada arrives off English shores. Amyas, with his ship, joins the rest of the fleet in that famous battle. After twelve terrible days, the Armada is defeated and almost every Spanish ship destroyed. Amyas, however, is not satisfied. Don Guzman is aboard one of the Spanish ships, and although Amyas pursues him relentlessly, he has to sit by and watch a storm tear the Spaniard\u2019s ship apart. Amyas curses that he himself was not able to kill Don Guzman and thus avenge his brother\u2019s death.As Don Guzman\u2019s ship breaks apart, a bolt of lightning strikes Amyas\u2019s ship, blinding him and killing Yeo. At first, Amyas is full of despair. One day, he has a vision. He sees Rose and Don Guzman together and knows that the Spaniard really loved her and mourned her until his death. Then he sees himself with Don Guzman, acknowledging their sins to each other and asking forgiveness. After that, he feels at peace with himself.Amyas returns to his mother\u2019s home, and there she and Ayacanora care for him. Realizing how much the girl loves him, he is so grateful for the tenderness she shows him that he gives her his heart. In Bideford, the blind hero spends his remaining days dreaming of his past deeds and of the great glory to come for his country and his queen.", "author": "Charles Kingsley"},
{"title": "The Waves", "summary": "\u00a0 The waves roll shoreward, and at daybreak the children awake. Watching the sunrise, Bernard, maker of phrases and seeker of causes, sees a loop of light \u2014 he will always think of it as a ring, the circle of experience giving life pattern and meaning. Shy, passionate Neville imagines a globe dangling against the flank of day. Susan, who loves fields and seasons, sees a slab of yellow, the crusted loaf, the buttered slice, of teatime in the country. Rhoda, awkward and timid, hears wild cries of startled birds. Sensuous, pleasure-loving Jinny sees a tassel of gold and crimson. Louis, of a race that had seen women carry red pitchers to the Nile, hears a chained beast stamping on the sands.\u00a0While the others play, Louis hides among the currants. Jinny, finding him there and pitying his loneliness, kisses him. Suddenly jealous, Susan runs away, and Bernard follows to comfort her. They walk across fields to Elvedon, where they see a woman writing at a window. Later, in the schoolroom, Louis refuses to recite because he is ashamed of his Australian accent. Rhoda is unable to do her sums and has to stay in. Louis pities her, for she is the one he does not fear.The day brightens. Bernard, older now, yawns through the headmaster\u2019s speech in chapel. Neville leans sideways to watch Percival, who sits flicking the back of his neck. A glance, a gesture, Neville realizes, and one could fall in love forever. Louis, liking order, sits quietly. As long as the headmaster talks, Louis forgets the snickers at his accent and memories of kisses underneath a hedge. Susan, Jinny, and Rhoda are in a school where they sit primly under a portrait of Queen Alexandra. Susan thinks of hay waving in the meadows at home. Jinny pictures a gold and crimson party dress. Rhoda dreams of picking flowers and offering them to someone whose face she has never seen.Time passes, and the last day of the term arrives. Louis goes to work in London after his father, a Brisbane banker, had failed. In his attic room, Louis sometimes hears the great beast stamping in the dark, but now the noise is that of city crowds and traffic. At Cambridge, Neville reads Catullus and waits with uneasy eagerness for Percival\u2019s smile or nod. Bernard is Byron\u2019s young man one day, Shelley\u2019s or Dostoevski\u2019s the next. One day, Neville brings him a poem. Reading it, Bernard feels that Neville will succeed and that he will fail. Neville is in love with Percival. In his phrase making, Bernard becomes many people \u2014 a plumber, a horse breeder, an old woman on the street. In Switzerland, Susan dreams of newborn lambs in baskets, of marsh mist and autumn rains, of the lover who will walk with her beside dusty hollyhocks. At a ball in London, Jinny, dancing, feels as if her body glows with inner fire. Rhoda, at the same ball, sits and stares across the rooftops.They all love Percival. Before he leaves for India, they meet at a dinner party in London to bid him good-bye. Bernard, not knowing that Susan loves him, is already engaged. Louis is learning to cover his shyness with brisk assurance; the poet has become a businessman. Rhoda is frightened by life. Waiters and diners look up when Jinny enters, lovely and poised. Susan arrives looking dowdy, hating London. Neville, loving Percival in secret, dreads the moment of parting that will carry him away. Here, thinks Bernard, is the ring he had seen long ago. Youth is friendship and a stirring in the blood, like the notes of Percival\u2019s wild hunting song.The sun passes the zenith, and shadows lengthen. When word comes that Percival has been killed in India, Neville feels as if that doom has been his own. He will go on to become a famous poet and scholar, always a lonely man waiting in his rooms for the footstep on the stair of this young man or that whom he will love in place of Percival. Bernard is married by now, and his son has been born. He thinks of Susan, whom Percival had loved. Rhoda also thinks of Susan, engaged to her farmer in the country. She remembers the dream in which she had offered flowers to a man whose face had been hidden from her, and she knows at last that the man had been Percival.Shadows grow longer over country and town. Louis, a wealthy, successful businessman, plans a place in Surrey with greenhouses and rare gardens. He still keeps his attic room, though, where Rhoda often visits; they have become lovers. Susan walks in the fields with her children or sits sewing by the firelight in a quiet room. Jinny grooms a body shaped for gaiety and pleasure. Neville measures time by the hours he spends waiting for the footstep on the stair, the young face at the door. Bernard tries to snare in phrases the old man on the train, the lovers in the park. The only realities, he thinks, are in common things. He realizes that he has lost friends by death \u2014 Percival for one \u2014 and others because he had not wished to cross the street. After Louis and Rhoda part, Louis gets a new mistress: a vulgar cockney actor. Rhoda, always in flight, goes to Spain. Climbing a hill to look across the sea toward Africa, she thinks of rest and longs for death.Slowly, the sun sets. At Hampton Court, the six friends meet again for dinner. They are old now, and each had gone a different way after Percival had died in India years before. Bernard feels that he has failed. He had wrapped himself in phrases; he had sons and daughters, but he had ventured no farther than Rome. He had not become rich, like Louis, or famous, like Neville. Jinny had lived only for pleasure, little enough, as she was learning. After dinner, Bernard and Susan walk by the lake. There is little of their true thoughts they can say to each other. Bernard, however, is still a maker of phrases. Percival, he says, had become like the flower on the table where they ate \u2014 six-sided, made from their six lives.So it seems to Bernard years later, after Rhoda had jumped to her death and the rest are even older. He wonders what the real truth had been beneath Louis\u2019s middle-class respectability, Rhoda\u2019s haunted imagination, Neville\u2019s passion for one love, Susan\u2019s primitivism, Jinny\u2019s sensuous pleasures, his own attempt to catch reality in a phrase. He had been Byron\u2019s young man and Dostoevski\u2019s and also the hairy old savage in the blood. Once he had seen a loop of light, a ring, but he had found no pattern and no meaning, only the knowledge that death is the great adversary against whom humans ride in the darkness where the waves break on the shore.", "author": "Virginia Woolf"},
{"title": "Waverley", "summary": "\u00a0 The English family of Waverley is long known for its Jacobite sympathies. In 1745, Waverley-Honour, the ancestral home of the family, is a quiet retreat for Sir Everard Waverley, an elderly Jacobite. In an attempt to seek political advantage in London, his brother, Richard Waverley, swears loyalty to the king.\u00a0Edward Waverley, the son of Whig Richard, divides his time between his father and his Uncle Everard at Waverley-Honour. On that great estate, Edward is free to come and to go as he pleases, for his tutor Pembroke, a devout dissenter, is often too busy writing religious pamphlets to spend much time with the education of his young charge. When Edward becomes old enough, his father obtains a commission in the army for him. Shortly afterward, he is ordered to Scotland to join the dragoons of Colonel Gardiner. Equipped with the necessary articles of dress, accompanied by a retinue of men selected by Sir Everard, and weighed down by the dissenting tomes of Pembroke, Edward leaves Waverley-Honour in quixotic fashion to conquer his world.He is instructed by Sir Everard to visit an old friend, Sir Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine, whose estate is near the village of Tully-Veolan in the Scottish Lowlands. Soon after his arrival at the post of Colonel Gardiner, Edward obtains leave to go to Tully-Veolan. There he finds Sir Everard\u2019s friend both cordial and happy to see him. The few days spent at Tully-Veolan convince Edward that Scotland is a wilder and a more romantic land than his native England. He pays little attention to Rose Bradwardine, the baron\u2019s daughter, his youthful imagination being fired instead by the songs and dances of Davie Gellatley, the baron\u2019s servant, and by tales about the Scottish Highlanders and their rude ways. At Tully-Veolan, he is also confronted by a political issue that was but an idealistic quarrel in his former existence; these Scottish people are Jacobites, and because of his father\u2019s politics and his own rank in the army of Hanoverian George II of England Edward ostensibly is a Whig Royalist.During his stay at Tully-Veolan, an event occurs that changes Edward\u2019s life. It begins with the unexpected arrival of Evan Dhu Maccombich, a Highlander in the service of the renowned clan chieftain Fergus Mac Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, a friend of the baron. Since his taste for romantic adventure is aroused, Edward begs another extension of his leave in order to accompany Evan Dhu into the Highlands. In those rugged hills, Edward is led to the cave that shelters the band of Donald Bean Lean, an outlaw who robs and plunders the wealthy Lowlanders. Staying with the bandit only long enough to discover the romantic attachment between Donald\u2019s daughter Alice and Evan Dhu, Edward again sets out into the hills with his cheerful young guide. His curiosity is sufficiently whetted by Evan\u2019s descriptions of Fergus Mac Ivor and his ancient castle deep in the Highland hills at Glennaquoich.The welcome Mac Ivor extends to Edward is openhanded and hearty. No less warm is the quiet greeting that Flora, Mac Ivor\u2019s sister, has for the English soldier. Flora is a beautiful woman of romantic, poetic nature, and Edward soon finds himself deeply in love with the chieftain\u2019s sister. Mac Ivor seems to sanction the idea of a marriage. That union can never be, however, for Flora vows her life to another cause \u2014 that of placing Charles, the young Stuart prince, on the throne of England. When Edward proposes marriage, Flora advises him to seek a woman who can attach herself wholeheartedly to his happiness; Flora claims that she cannot divide her attentions between the Jacobite cause and marriage to one who is not an ardent supporter of Charles Edward Stuart.Edward\u2019s stay at Glennaquoich is interrupted by letters carried to him by Davie Gellatley from Tully-Veolan. The first is from Rose, who advises him that the Lowlands are in a state of revolt. Since her father is absent, she warns Edward not to return to Tully-Veolan. The other letters inform him that Richard Waverley engaged in some unfortunate political maneuvers that caused his political downfall. On the heels of this news come orders from Colonel Gardiner, who, having heard reports of Edward\u2019s association with traitors, is relieving the young officer of his command. Repulsed by Flora and disgraced in his army career, Edward resolves to return to Waverley-Honour. He equips himself suitably for the dangerous journey and sets out toward the Lowlands.Because of armed revolt in Scotland and the linking of the Waverley name with the Jacobite cause, Edward finds himself under arrest for treason against King George. The dissenting pamphlets of Pembroke that he carries, his stay in the Highlands, and the company he keeps there are suspicious circumstances that make it impossible for him to prove his innocence. He is captured by some of the king\u2019s troops and turned over to an armed guard with orders to take him to Stirling Castle for trial on a charge of treason.Because he is a friend of Mac Ivor, however, a quick ambush rescues Edward from his captors, and he finds himself once again in the hands of Highlanders. He recognizes them as a party of Donald Bean Lean\u2019s followers. Indeed, Alice once appears among the men to slip a packet of letters to him, but at the time, he has no opportunity to read the papers she gives him so secretively.A few days\u2019 journey brings Edward to the center of Jacobite activities at Holyrood, the temporary court of Charles Edward Stuart, who secretly crosses the channel from France. There Edward finds Mac Ivor awaiting him. When the Highlander presents Edward to Charles, the Pretender welcomes the English youth because of the name he bears. The prince, trained in French courts, is a model of refinement and courtesy. His heartfelt trust gives Edward a feeling of belonging, particularly because he lost his commission, his cause unheard, in the English army. When Charles asks him to join in the Scottish uprising, Edward assents. Mac Ivor seems quite happy about Edward\u2019s new allegiance. When the young Englishman asks about Flora, Mac Ivor explains that he brought her along to the prince\u2019s court so that she can help him gain a political foothold once the battle is won. Edward resents this manner of using Flora as bait, but soon he perceives that the court of the Pretender functions very much like the French court where Charles and his followers learned statecraft. Mac Ivor presses Edward to continue his courtship of Flora. The sister of Mac Ivor, however, meets his advances coldly. In the company of the Highland beauty is Rose, whose father also joins the Stuart cause.Edward is accepted as a cavalier by the women who cluster around Charles. Under the influence of the Pretender\u2019s courtly manners, Edward soon becomes a favorite, but Mac Ivor\u2019s sister persists in ignoring him. He begins to compare the two women, Rose and Flora, and Rose gains favor in his eyes as he watches them together.The expedition of the Pretender and his Highlanders is doomed to failure. As they march southward to England, they begin to lose hope. The prince orders a retreat to Scotland. Many of the clansmen are killed at the disastrous Battle of Culloden. The survivors escape to the Highlands to spend their days in hiding from troops sent to track them down. A few are fortunate enough to make their way in safety to France.Edward manages to get away and to find a friend who helps him to steal back to Scotland, where he hopes to find Rose. By now, Edward clears himself of the earlier charges of treachery and desertion, which were the initial cause of his joining the Pretender. It is Donald Bean Lean who deceives Colonel Gardiner with a false report of Edward\u2019s activities. The letters Alice slips to him convey that information to Edward. Now he hopes to escape to France with Rose and wait for a pardon from England. Richard Waverley dies, and Edward inherits his fortune.Mac Ivor and Evan Dhu are executed for their crimes against the Crown, and the power of the Highland clan is broken. Flora enters a Catholic convent in France, the country in which she was reared. Edward and Rose are married once Edward makes certain of his pardon. They return to Tully-Veolan, where the baron\u2019s estate awaits its heirs.", "author": "Sir Walter Scott"},
{"title": "War and Peace", "summary": "\u00a0 In 1805, it is evident to most well-informed Russians that war with Napoleon is inevitable. Austria and Russia join forces at the Battle of Austerlitz, where they are soundly defeated by the French. In the highest Russian society, however, life goes on as though nothing of tremendous import were impending. After all, it is really only by a political formality that Russia has joined with Austria. The fact that one day Napoleon might threaten the gates of Russia seems ridiculous. Soirees and balls are held, old women gossip, and young women fall in love. War, though inevitable, is being waged on foreign soil and is, therefore, of little importance.\u00a0The attraction that military service holds for the young noblemen of Russia is understandable enough, for the Russian army has always offered excellent opportunities for ambitious, politically inclined young men. The army provides a wholesome release for their energies. Young Nikolay Rostov, for example, joins the hussars simply because he feels drawn to that way of life. His family idolizes him because of his loyalty to the czar, because of his courage, and because he is so handsome in his uniform. Natasha, his sister, weeps over him, and Sonya, his cousin, promptly falls in love with him.By contrast, Pierre Bezuhov, a friend of the Rostov family, is looked upon as somewhat of a boor. He has just returned from Paris, where he studied at the university, and he has not yet made up his mind what to do with his life. He will not join the army, for he sees no sense in a military career. His father gives him a liberal allowance, and he spends it frivolously at gambling. In truth, he seems like a lost man. He starts long arguments, shouting loudly in quiet drawing rooms, and then suddenly lapses into sullen silence. He is barely tolerated at soirees until his father dies and leaves him a fortune; then, suddenly, he becomes popular. He attributes his rise to some new personality development of his own, and he is no longer sullen; rather, he loves everyone, and it is quite clear that everyone loves him. His most dogged follower is Prince Vassily Kuragin, the father of a beautiful, unmarried daughter, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is recognized everywhere as a prospective leader of St. Petersburg society. Pierre is forced into marrying her by the crafty prince, who knows a good catch when he sees one. The marriage, however, is not a success.Pierre Bezuhov\u2019s closest friend is Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, an arrogant, somewhat cynical man who despises his wife, Lise. The \u201cLittle Princess,\u201d as Lise is called, is pregnant, but Prince Andrey can endure the bondage of domesticity no longer. When he receives a commission in the army, he leaves Lise at the family estate, Bleak Hills, in the care of his sister Marya and his tyrannical old father and goes off to war. During his absence, Princess Lise gives birth to a son but dies during childbirth. Prince Andrey returns after the Battle of Austerlitz to find himself free once more, but he enjoys no feeling of satisfaction in his freedom. He seeks out Pierre and turns to his friend for answers to some of the eternal questions of loneliness and despair that torture him.Pierre has joined the brotherhood of freemasons and, through his association with the group, has arrived at a philosophy of life that he sincerely believes to be the only true philosophy. Had Pierre realized that the order initiated him solely because of his wealth, he would never have adopted the members\u2019 ideals. Pierre restores some of Prince Andrey\u2019s lost courage, however, by means of his wild if unreasoning enthusiasm. In the belief that he is now an unselfish, free individual, Pierre frees his peasants and sets about improving his estate; having absolutely no sense of business administration, he loses a great deal of money. Finally, with his affairs in hopeless disorder, he leaves an overseer in charge and retires to Bleak Hills and Prince Andrey\u2019s sane company.Nikolay Rostov is in the thick of the fighting. Napoleon overcame the Prussian forces at Jena and reached Berlin in October, 1806. The Russians once more go to the assistance of their neighbors, and the two opposing armies meet in a terrible battle at Eylau in February, 1807. In June, Nikolay enters the campaign at Friedland, and when the Russians are beaten, he na\u00efvely thinks the war is over. Napoleon and Czar Alexander sign the Peace of Tilsit, and Napoleon, who possesses a remarkable gift for flattery, promises, with no intention of keeping his word, that Russia will be given a free hand with Turkey and Finland. For two years, Nikolay enjoys all the privileges of his post in the army without having to endure any of the risks. Napoleon has gone to Spain.After having served in minor skirmishes as an adjutant under General Kutuzov, leader of the Russian forces, Prince Andrey returns to the country. He has some business affairs to straighten out with Count Rostov, marshal of his district, and so he goes to the Rostov estate at Otradnoe. There Andrey almost immediately falls under the spell of Count Rostov\u2019s lovely young daughter, Natasha. He fancies himself in love as he has never loved before. Once again, he turns to Pierre for advice. Pierre, however, has experienced an unfortunate quarrel with his wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. They are now separated, and Pierre has fought a senseless duel with an innocent man because he suspected his wife of being unfaithful. At the sight of Prince Andrey so hopelessly in love, Pierre\u2019s great heart is touched. He has always been fond of Natasha, whom he has known since childhood, and the match seems to him ideal. With love once more flowing through his heart, he takes his wife back, feeling very virtuous at his own generosity, and he encourages Prince Andrey in his suit.Natasha has ignored previous offers of marriage, but when the dashing and wealthy Prince Andrey comes on the scene, she loses her heart to him instantly. He asks her parents for her hand, and they immediately consent to the match, an excellent one from their point of view. When Prince Andrey breaks the news to his quarrelsome and dictatorial old father, however, the ancient prince says that he will not give his blessing until a year has elapsed. He feels that Natasha has too little money and is much too young to take charge of Prince Andrey\u2019s home and his son. Marya, Prince Andrey\u2019s sister, also disapproves of the match, for she is jealous of her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9.Natasha is heartbroken but agrees to wait a year; Prince Andrey keeps their betrothal a secret, in order, as he says, to let her have complete freedom. Natasha goes to Moscow to visit a family friend, and there her freedom is too complete. One night she attends the opera with Pierre\u2019s wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is now recognized as an important social leader; there she meets H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s disreputable brother, Anatole. Unknown to Natasha, Anatole had been forced to marry a peasant girl whom he had ruined. The young rake now determines to conquer Natasha. Aided by his unscrupulous sister, he forces his suit, and Natasha becomes confused. She loves Prince Andrey, but he has joined the army again and she never sees him; she also loves Anatole, who is becoming more insistent every day. At last, she agrees to run away with Anatole and marry him. Anatole arranges with a defrocked priest to have a mock ceremony performed. On the night set for the elopement, however, Natasha\u2019s host discovers the plan, and Natasha is confined to her room. Unfortunately, she has already written to Prince Andrey\u2019s sister to ask to be relieved of her betrothal vows.When Pierre hears of the scandal, he forces Anatole to leave town. He then goes to see Natasha. Strangely, he is the only person whom she trusts and to whom she can speak freely. She looks upon him as if he were an older uncle, and she is charmed with his gruff friendliness. Pierre feels attracted to Natasha in a way he knows he should not be, as he is not free, but he manages to let her know that he will be a friend to her, and she is pleased by his attentions. She soon begins to recover from her misfortune, but she will never again be the lively, frivolous girl whom Prince Andrey had loved.Natasha\u2019s actions have dealt Prince Andrey a terrible blow to his pride, but in the army there are many engrossing matters to take his attention away from himself. By 1810, the Franco-Russian alliance has gradually dissolved. When France threatens to free Russia of responsibility for Poland, the czar finally understands that Napoleon\u2019s promises meant little. The dapper little French emperor has forsaken Russia in favor of Austria as the center of his European domination. He marries Marie Louise, and, in 1812, with his eyes unmistakably fixed on Moscow, he crosses the Nieman River. From June to August, Napoleon enjoys an almost uninterrupted march to Smolensk.In Smolensk, he finds burned and wrecked houses. The city is deserted. This marks the beginning of fierce opposition. Old General Kutuzov, former leader of the army of the East and now in complete charge of the Russian forces, is determined to halt the French advance. His tactics, however, are the very reason the Russians fail to win a decisive victory. Instead of attempting to halt the French, he might have succeeded by drawing them deeper and deeper into the country, lengthening their lines of communication and cutting them off in the rear. It is odd, too, that Napoleon, in attempting to complete his march, also lessens his chances for victory.Battle succeeds battle, with heavy losses on both sides, before Napoleon finally leads his forces to Borodino. There the most senseless battle in the whole campaign is fought. The Russians, determined to hold Moscow, which is only a short distance away, lose nearly their whole army. The French forces dwindle in proportion, but it is clear that the Russians have gotten the worst of the battle. General Kutuzov, bitter and war-weary, decides, against his will, that the army cannot hold Moscow. Again a triumphant Napoleon marches into a deserted city.Prince Andrey has been gravely wounded at Borodino. The Rostovs are already abandoning their estate to move into the interior when many wagons loaded with wounded soldiers are brought to the house for shelter. Among these is Prince Andrey himself. Natasha nurses him and sends for Marya, his sister, and his son, Nikolushka. Old Prince Bolkonsky, suffering from the shock of having French soldiers almost upon his doorstep, dies of a stroke. Nikolay manages to move Marya and the boy to safer quarters. Although Prince Andrey welcomes his sister, it is evident that he no longer expects to recover. Natasha nurses him tenderly, and they once more declare their love for each other. When his wound festers, Prince Andrey knows that the end is near; soon after, he dies in his sleep. United in tragedy, Marya and Natasha become close friends; young Nikolay finds Prince Andrey\u2019s sister attractive.Pierre Bezuhov decides to remain in Moscow. Fired with thoughts of becoming a national hero, he hits upon the plan of assassinating Napoleon. He is captured as a prisoner of war, however, when he attempts to rescue a Russian woman who is being molested by French soldiers.Napoleon\u2019s army completely disintegrates in Moscow. After waiting in vain for peace terms from the czar, Napoleon decides to abandon Moscow and head back to France. His soldiers \u2014 a ragged, irresponsible, pillaging group, once part of the most powerful army in the world \u2014 gather up their booty, throw away their supplies, and start off on the road back to Smolensk as winter comes on, taking prisoners with them. Pierre Bezuhov, luckily, is at the outset robust and healthy. Traveling with the other prisoners, he learns from experience that happiness can consist of merely being warm and having enough to eat. His privations age and mature him. He learns responsibility and gains courage, and he develops a sense of humor at the irony of his plight. His simplicity and even temperament make him a favorite with the French and the Russians alike.On the road to Smolensk, the French forces become completely demoralized. Cossacks charge out of the forests and cut the lines, taking countless French prisoners and rescuing the Russian captives. Many Frenchmen desert; others fall ill and die on the road. Pierre is freed at last, and he returns to Orel, where he falls ill with fever. Later he learns of the deaths of Prince Andrey and his own wife. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had died in St. Petersburg after a short illness. These shocks, coupled with the news of the defeat of the French, seem to deprive him of all feeling. When he finally recovers, he is overwhelmed with a joyous sense of freedom of soul, a sense that he has at last found himself, that he knows himself for what he really is. He knows the sheer joy of being alive, and he is humble and grateful. He has discovered a faith in God that he never knew before.Pierre returns to Moscow and renews his friendships with Marya Bolkonskaya and the Rostovs. Once more Natasha charms him, and Pierre suddenly realizes that she is no longer a child. He loves her now, as always, and so when the opportunity presents itself, he dutifully asks Natasha\u2019s parents for her hand in marriage. The two marry and go on to be very happy together. Natasha is an efficient wife who dominates her husband, much to the amusement of their friends; Pierre loves her and respects her because she knows how to take charge of everything. She manages his estates as well as their household.Nikolay, though not entirely sure that he loves Marya, knows that to marry her would be a wise thing. The Rostovs are poor now, and the old count has left his affairs in a deplorable state. At the insistence of his mother, Nikolay finally proposes to Marya, and the two families are joined. The union proves happier than Nikolay had expected, and he and Marya adopt Prince Andrey\u2019s son, Nikolushka.Pierre and Natasha eventually have four fine children of whom they are very proud. Although society thinks that Natasha carries her devotion to her husband and children to an extreme, Natasha and Pierre are happier than they have ever been before, and they find their life together to be a fulfillment of all their dreams.", "author": "Leo Tolstoy"},
{"title": "The Wapshot Scandal", "summary": "\u00a0 Honora Wapshot is an eccentric spinster and the septuagenarian guardian of the Wapshot treasure trove, oldest living descendant of a family that settled in the town of St. Botolphs, Massachusetts, in the seventeenth century. Honora supervises \u2014 but mainly underwrites with quarterly checks from a trust fund \u2014 the lives of her two young cousins, Moses and Coverly Wapshot. The two brothers have lost both their mother, Sarah, and their father, Leander, who drowned while swimming.\u00a0After a Christmas visit to Honora during which he is haunted by the ghost of his high-minded father, Coverly travels west. He returns to a world that would have baffled his father \u2014 the Talifer Missile Site. At this top-secret complex of experimental laboratories and space-travel equipment, some irrevocable error by a personnel-selecting machine has recently placed Coverly in the department of public relations, although he was trained for computer programming. He lives in Talifer with his wife, Betsey, and their son, Binxey, but their social life in the community is a little bleak. One day Betsey, after watching with bland indifference as a neighbor falls to his death on a cement terrace, neglects to notify anyone because of her vague fear that she might violate security regulations. Coming home one day, Coverly learns that their garbage pail has been taken by a neighbor, and Coverly and the neighbor\u2019s husband come to blows and bites over the incident. Shortly afterward, Betsey and Coverly attempt to meet their neighbors (who have never called on them since their arrival) by inviting twenty-five people to a cocktail party; the plan is aborted, however, when no one appears. Betsey is shattered, and her reaction takes the form of a lasting resentment of Coverly, whom she blames for making her live in Talifer.Through a strange accident of circumstance, Coverly is offered a position on the personal staff of Dr. Lemuel Cameron, the egomaniacal titan of the missile complex. Coverly, however, is entirely at the mercy of Cameron\u2019s caprice and soon discovers that he is nothing more than a chauffeur for the great man. Also, beneath the surface of Cameron\u2019s brilliance and cultural pretensions (he is capable of quoting a little poetry) lies the viciousness of a man who professes a belief in the blessedness of the universe but who talks with perfect equanimity of the destruction of the world. Cameron also suffers agonies of lust that can be satisfied only by a mistress in Rome, beats his subordinates in ferocious outbursts of temper, and has driven his son to insanity by practicing hideous extremes of cruelty in the name of discipline. In a short time, therefore, Coverly finds that he has hitched his wagon to a rather sinister star.When Coverly\u2019s security clearance at the missile site is withdrawn because of Honora\u2019s delinquency on her federal income tax, he expects that Cameron will get him reinstated. When he goes for that purpose to Washington, where Cameron is being questioned by a congressional committee, Coverly witnesses a rather startling phenomenon: As a result of Cameron\u2019s savage temperament, his own security clearance is withdrawn.Moses Wapshot has trouble with his work but far more trouble with his wife, Melissa. He works at a brokerage house (presumably in New York City), and the couple lives with their son in an affluent suburban cocoon called Proxmire Manor, where the only thing that occupies the police is the memory that once, several years prior to the time of the novel, a woman was arrested for tearing up a parking ticket. The community makes a pretense of maintaining rigid moral standards. Melissa quickly learns, for example, that a certain couple is being expelled from Proxmire Manor because the wife has been flagrantly promiscuous, notably with grocery boys and deliverymen. Melissa is bored with such standards, and she becomes a little unhinged when she stumbles across \u201cevidence\u201d of lesbianism at a local dance that evening. Shortly thereafter, she develops a fondness and then a passion for Emile Cranmer, the boy who delivers her groceries. She seduces him without much difficulty. They begin with a weekend at her house in Nantucket, followed by rendezvous in Boston, in New York, and, eventually, in a little shack outside the town of Proxmire Manor.Emile engages in the affair with little compunction; Melissa\u2019s money buys him food to satisfy an insatiable appetite and supplies him with expensive baubles, such as an eight-hundred-dollar sapphire ring. Melissa pays much more than money to maintain the affair. After meeting Emile for the third time, she is tortured with remorse and seeks release in drunkenness. When she goes to a doctor for a physical examination, she becomes so aroused that she ends up having sex with him. As a last resort, she seeks the counsel of the minister, who does nothing but refer her to the town psychiatrist. Melissa, however, will not settle for the explanation that she is simply sick (and therefore irresponsible). She has only one place left to go \u2014 back to Emile.Moses learns of his wife\u2019s infidelity from Emile\u2019s mother. The impact of the news is explosive: He nearly strangles his wife, then he leaves his home and turns to drink and dissipation. Through a series of bizarre and elaborate maneuvers, Melissa manages to meet Emile in Italy, where she has gone with her son. She buys Emile at an auction in Ladros for a hundred thousand lire; they retire to her luxurious villa, and they are last seen together in Rome. For his part, Moses abandons himself completely to sex and alcohol. On Christmas Eve, at the end of the novel, Coverly finds him in the upstairs room of the St. Botolphs hotel drunkenly wallowing in the embrace of an equally inebriated widow. Moses goes home with Coverly to Honora\u2019s house, but the next morning he shuts himself in a closet full of bourbon.During all of this, Honora has been steadily losing her grip. She seems at first incapable of any serious wrong, but then she learns that because she has never paid any federal income tax, she faces a criminal indictment. Her friend Judge Beasley recommends that she take her money out of the bank and leave the country. She follows his advice and decides on a ship to Europe, but this move is scarcely the end of her troubles. On the ship she is flattered by the attentions of a nice-mannered young man who helps her to get around the decks; when he tells her that he is a stowaway, she arranges for him to be fed regularly in her cabin, and she develops enough interest in him to be capable of jealousy when she sees him in the company of another woman. One morning, however, in the early hours, he attempts to steal her money belt, and she strikes him over the head with a brass lamp. She thinks at first that he is dead, but he survives the blow and pursues his calling elsewhere. Before the ship docks at Naples, Honora sees him strolling by with another aging victim on his arm. Her only way of releasing her fury is by striking out at the entire ship, which she does through the simple expedient of plugging her curling iron into an outlet in the bathroom of her cabin. This, as she has already discovered, has the effect of blowing out the ship\u2019s generators.Honora enters the Bay of Naples, therefore, on a ship in darkness. In Italy, she finds little to brighten her world. She visits the pope in the Vatican, but his rather precarious command of the English language frustrates communication between them and only sharpens her nostalgic yearning for the familiar territory of St. Botolphs. A short time later, her wish to return is satisfied, but in a cruelly unexpected way. Norman Johnson, an agent of the Internal Revenue Service who had visited her first in St. Botolphs, now comes to her calmly and politely with extradition papers, a criminal indictment, and an order for the confiscation of all her property. She returns to St. Botolphs immediately and spends the last of her days immured in her old house, consuming nothing but bourbon. Shortly before Christmas, she is pronounced dead of starvation. She leaves Coverly with the command to hold a Christmas dinner in her house for the inmates of the local institute for the blind. Coverly executes her wish.", "author": "John Cheever"},

{"title": "Waiting for Godot", "summary": "\u00a0 Estragon tries to take off his boot but fails. Vladimir agrees with him that it sometimes appears that there is nothing one could do. They are glad to be reunited after a night apart. With Vladimir\u2019s help, Estragon succeeds in removing his boot, which was causing him pain. Vladimir, also in pain, cannot laugh in comfort; he tries smiling instead, but it is not satisfactory.\u00a0Vladimir muses on the one Gospel account that says Christ saved one of the thieves. Estragon wants to leave, but they cannot leave because they are waiting for Godot. They become confused about the arrangements and wonder if they are waiting at the right time, in the right place, and on the right day. They quarrel briefly but then, as always, they reconcile.Estragon and Vladimir consider hanging themselves from the nearby tree but decide that it would be safer to do nothing until they hear what Godot says. They do not know what they have asked Godot for. They conclude that they have forgone their rights. Vladimir gives Estragon a carrot, which he eats hungrily. They decide that although they are not bound to Godot, they are in fact unable to act.Pozzo enters, driving Lucky, who is laden with luggage, by a rope around his neck. Estragon and Vladimir mistake Pozzo for Godot but accept him as Pozzo. Although he attempts to intimidate them, he is glad of their company. After ordering Lucky to bring him his stool and his coat, Pozzo gives Lucky the whip. Lucky obeys automatically. Vladimir and Estragon protest violently against Pozzo\u2019s treatment of Lucky, but Pozzo deflects their outburst and the subject is dropped.After smoking a pipe, Pozzo rises. He then decides he does not want to leave, but his pride almost prevents him from reseating himself. The tramps want to know why Lucky never puts down the luggage. Pozzo says that Lucky is trying to make Pozzo keep him. When Pozzo adds that he would sell Lucky rather than throw him out, Lucky weeps. Estragon tries to dry the servant\u2019s tears, but Lucky kicks him away; Estragon then weeps. Pozzo philosophizes on this and says that Lucky has taught him all the beautiful things he knows but that the fellow has now become unbearable and is driving him mad. Estragon and Vladimir then abuse Lucky for mistreating his master.Pozzo breaks into a monologue on the twilight, alternating between the lyrical and the commonplace and ending with the bitter thought that everything happens in the world when one is least prepared. He decides to reward Estragon and Vladimir for praising him by making Lucky entertain them. Lucky executes a feeble dance that Estragon mocks but fails to imitate.Estragon states that there have been no arrivals, no departures, and no action, and that everything is terrible. Pozzo next decides that Lucky should think for them. For this Vladimir replaces Lucky\u2019s derby hat. Lucky\u2019s thoughts are an incoherent flood of words resembling a dissertation on the possible goodness of God, the tortures of hellfire, the prevalence of sport, and the vacuity of suburbs. The words desperately upset Lucky\u2019s listeners, who attack him and silence him by seizing his hat. Having restored Lucky to his position as carrier, Pozzo and the tramps say many farewells before Pozzo and Lucky finally leave.The Boy calls to Vladimir and Estragon. He brings a message from Godot, who will come the next evening. The Boy, a goatherd, says that Godot is kind to him, but he beats the Boy\u2019s brother, a shepherd. Vladimir asks the Boy to tell Godot only that he has seen them.By the time the Boy leaves, night has fallen. Estragon decides to abandon his boots to someone else. Vladimir protests, and Estragon says that Christ went barefoot. Once again they consider and reject the idea of separating. They decide to leave for the night, but they stay where they are.The following evening, the boots are still there and the tree has grown some leaves. The tramps have spent the night separately. Vladimir returns first. When Estragon comes back, he says that he has been beaten again, and Vladimir feels that he could have prevented such cruelty. Vladimir begins to talk of the previous day, but Estragon can remember nothing about it except for his being kicked. They are then overwhelmed by the thought of the whispering voices of the dead around them. They try to break their silence but succeed only in part. By a great effort, Estragon recalls that he and the others spent the previous day chattering inanities. He reflects that they have spent fifty years doing no more than that.They discover that the boots left behind by Estragon have been exchanged for another old pair. After finding Lucky\u2019s hat, which assures them that they have returned to the right place, they start a wild exchange of that hat and their two hats, shifting them from hand to hand. Finally Vladimir keeps Lucky\u2019s hat and Estragon keeps his own.Once more Estragon decides to leave. To distract him, Vladimir suggests that they \u201cplay\u201d Pozzo and Lucky. Puzzled, Estragon leaves, but he returns almost immediately because some people are coming. Vladimir is jubilant, convinced that Godot is arriving. They try to hide, but there is nowhere for them to go. Finally Lucky enters with Pozzo, who is now blind. Lucky falls and drags Pozzo down with him. Pozzo cries for help, and Vladimir passionately wishes to act while he has the opportunity to do one good thing as a member of the human race, a species that appalls him. Pozzo is terrified, and Vladimir also falls in his attempts to raise him. Estragon falls too while trying to lift Vladimir. As Estragon and Vladimir fight and argue on the ground, they call Pozzo \u201cCain\u201d and \u201cAbel.\u201d When he responds to both names they conclude that he is all of humanity. Suddenly they get up without difficulty.Pozzo prepares to leave, but Vladimir wants Lucky to sing first. Pozzo explains that Lucky is dumb. Estragon and Vladimir want to know when he was afflicted, and Pozzo, angry, says that all their lives are merely momentary and time does not matter. He leaves with Lucky.While Estragon sleeps, the Boy enters to say that Godot will come, not that night but the next. The message for Godot is that the Boy has seen Vladimir. The Boy leaves, and Estragon awakes. He immediately wants to leave, but Vladimir insists that they cannot go far because they must return the next night in order to wait for Godot, who will punish them if they do not wait.Estragon and Vladimir remark that only the tree in the landscape is alive, and they consider hanging themselves again. Instead, they decide that if Godot does not come to save them the next night, they will hang themselves. At last the tramps decide to go, but they remain immobile.", "author": "Samuel Beckett"},
{"title": "Waiting", "summary": "\u00a0 Every summer for the past eighteen years, army doctor Lin Kong has returned to his house in Goose Village to try to divorce his wife, Shuyu, whom he had married by arrangement. Like years before, the separated couple travels to the court of Wujia Town to initiate the divorce, but Shuyu always changes her mind. On occasion, Shuyu\u2019s brother, Bensheng, a greedy and simple-minded peasant, travels with the couple. In front of others, he shames his brother-in-law, Lin. He reminds him of Shuyu\u2019s loyalty and her sacrificial care for his parents prior to their deaths. Defeated once again, Lin returns to his job at the hospital in Muji City and delivers the disappointing news to his girlfriend, Manna Wu, a nurse.\u00a0It is now 1964, and Manna enrolls at the hospital for studies in nursing. She is in her mid-twenties. During her studies, she gets romantically involved with a lieutenant from Shanghai. After a brief courtship based on camaraderie and celibacy, they two are engaged; but the affair suffers when they are separated by duty. Upon her graduation, Manna is assigned to stay at the army hospital, while her fianc\u00e9 is transferred to a regiment on the Russian border. A correspondence ensues, during which Manna\u2019s fianc\u00e9 eventually breaks their engagement and marries his cousin in Shanghai. By that time, Manna is twenty-six years old, and because she is quite a plain woman, her chances of marriage are slim. In addition, the rules of conduct forbid the hospital\u2019s doctors to date or marry their coworkers, so they seek their partners elsewhere.In her first \u2014 and failed \u2014 relationship, Manna confides in Lin, her teacher and a married man of good reputation. At first, the two are no more than comrades, and she has helped him make dust jackets for his multiple books. One day, Manna\u2019s feet are brutally blistered in a long-distance training march, so Lin takes care of her at a rest stop at a farmhouse. Because of his kindness, the young woman develops a crush on him. As a gift, she gives him a ticket to an opera of a patriotic theme, and on the day of the event, Lin is surprised to find Manna sitting in the seat next to his. Her affection for him becomes obvious: During the performance she touches his hand, a gesture, albeit bold and inappropriate, that inspires Lin to dream of the young woman that same night. The comrades begin spending more time together, but their friendship is strictly platonic.As gossip at the hospital insinuates their affair, Lin is called into a meeting with Ran Su, the vice director of the political department at the hospital. Lin promises to maintain the propriety of their relationship until he can legally divorce his wife. Encouraged by her girlfriend, Haiyan Niu, Manna arranges for a place where she and Lin can be intimate. Lin rejects the idea, leaving Manna wondering about the nature of his affection for her. Lin is indeed uncertain about his love for Manna. The two go through a brief breakup, but after reconciliation, Lin seriously considers the option of divorce.Lin and Shuyu\u2019s marriage was never based on physical or intellectual intimacy. Still, he enjoys returning to Goose Village, where he finds comfort and peace in the old, simpler ways of living. Shuyu\u2019s love for Lin is sacrificial. She is a simple woman, an obliging wife, a good homemaker and cook; she never nags him for money despite a very modest lifestyle that she and her daughter can afford on Lin\u2019s allowance. However, she is a woman of the old ways. To Lin\u2019s embarrassment, her feet are bound according to custom; and although never an attractive woman in the first place, years of hard work have taken a toll on her appearance. Only a year his junior, she looks much older than he. Lin decides that the only basis for his divorce could be the lack of love in his marriage, but in truth, he is unable to feel love toward either Shuyu or Manna.During the next eighteen years, Manna is presented with a couple of opportunities for marriage. The first candidate is Lin\u2019s cousin Liang Meng, a teacher and a widower with three children. He writes a letter to Lin about the hardships of raising his children alone, and Lin agrees to set him up with Manna. She agrees to a date, but chooses at this time to compare the two men; she dismisses Liang Meng as bookish.Another opportunity arrives from the higher powers at the hospital. Vice Commissar Wei, whose wife has been sent to a labor camp for writing a counter-revolutionary booklet, is in search of her replacement among the hospital staff. Despite his jealousy, Lin agrees to let Manna meet him. On the second date, the vice commissar lends Manna a copy of poet Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass (1855), about which she agrees to write him a letter. Unable to understand the book, Manna asks for Lin\u2019s assistance, and Lin takes on the task. Although Manna\u2019s essay impresses the vice commissar, he rejects Manna\u2019s candidacy based on the letter\u2019s poor handwriting. In truth, he has been dating several women at once, eventually hiring a young teacher for the job. The rejection spurs more gossip at the hospital, and with time, it turns Manna more bitter; she becomes hopeless about her future.One spring, Lin contracts tuberculosis and is quarantined at the hospital. Rooming with him is Geng Yang, an officer to whom Manna had been introduced at the movie theater on her date with the vice commissar. Manna visits Lin, who introduces her as his girlfriend. Later, when the two patients are alone, Lin confides in Geng Yang about his failed attempts to divorce his wife. He also confesses about the strictly platonic nature of his relationship with Manna and about her virginity.After his recovery, Lin departs for Shenyang City to attend a program for officers. With the excuse of having some of Lin\u2019s books in his possession, Geng Yang lures Manna into his hospital room and rapes her. Although Manna does not tell authorities, she confides in her friend Haiyan, who then tells her husband. The gossip travels quickly, and although there is no dishonorable pregnancy after the rape, Manna\u2019s reputation worsens even more. Lin learns of the rape from Manna upon his return six weeks later. By this time, Geng Yang has fully recovered and is discharged from the army.It is now 1983, and Lin has been separated from Shuyu for eighteen years, long enough to acquit the marriage without a partner\u2019s consent. They go to the People\u2019s Court in Muji City, and the divorce is settled peacefully. Lin goes on to arrange for Shuyu\u2019s permit to live and work in the city and later finds a city job for his daughter, Hua. He sells the house in Goose Village and, against all objections by his brother, Bensheng, leaves the stock to his older brother. For reasons of propriety, Lin and Manna wait before applying for their marriage license, after which preparations for the wedding take a full course. They have a traditional communist wedding ceremony, at which homage is paid to Chairman Mao Zedong, and the two are finally married; but the groom is bored, and the bride leaves the ceremony in tears after Ran Su calls their love bitter.In marriage, Manna turns out to be a passionate lover, which leaves her new husband exhausted; when it begins to affect his job, he asks her to take it easier on him. Soon, Manna is pregnant with twins. Lin first attempts to persuade her to have an abortion, but she is determined. By now, she is forty-four years old. The pregnancy is difficult, and Lin realizes that the years of waiting have turned Manna into a bitter, boring woman. The birth of their sons, River and Lake, strains the marriage even more. The babies are born sickly and recover only because of an old remedy from Hua, who visits her father often to help out with the chores that Manna barely fulfills.The pregnancy has worsened Manna\u2019s heart, and according to the doctors, she does not have long to live.

{"title": "Volupt\u00e9", "summary": "\u00a0 On the ship that takes him to the United States, probably forever, Amaury undertakes to tell the story of his life to a young friend. Having renounced his past life to live a new one abroad, he is afraid that he might find more pleasure than he should in those past memories; but he feels that his experience can prove useful to the young man, in whom he recognizes so many of his own tendencies.\u00a0Amaury, losing his parents, was reared by an uncle in Brittany. In his youth he was sheltered from the world outside his house, which at that time was slowly recovering from the effects of the French Revolution. He spent most of his time studying, and, prone to dreaming, he was actually more concerned with the adventures of Cyrus, Alexander, and Constantine than he was with the men and events of his own day. His Latin teacher was Monsieur Ploa, a man absolutely devoid of personal ambition; only a misinterpretation of Vergil or Cicero could momentarily get him excited. Monsieur Ploa had Amaury translate the voluptuous passages of the Aeneid (c. 29-19 b.c.e.; English translation, 1553) or the Odes (23 b.c.e., 13 b.c.e.; English translation, 1621) of Horace with a complete candor that his disciple did not share.When Amaury was about fifteen years old, he spent six weeks at a neighboring castle. His life there, no longer checked by his regular schedule, helped to develop his tendency to melancholy; he would disappear into the woods reciting poetry with tears in his eyes, and he would forget to come back for meals.At the age of eighteen, he began visiting friends in the neighborhood. He would often visit Monsieur and Madame de Greneuc, in whose household lived two granddaughters orphaned during the revolution. The older, Am\u00e9lie de Liniers, was a charming woman who soon considered herself engaged to him. Amaury, however, did not feel like settling down in life without first learning something of the world.During a hunting party, Amaury met the Marquis de Coua\u00ebn, an influential figure in royalist circles, who invited the young man to his castle. There Amaury met Madame de Coua\u00ebn, the Irish wife of the marquis. One day, Amaury wandered in the woods, lost in his thoughts. As he emerged from the woods, Madame de Coua\u00ebn called to him from the window and asked him to pick up an ivory needle she lost. When he took it up to her, she asked him if he would, in the absence of her husband, accompany her to the little chapel of Saint-Pierre-de-Mer before the sun set. As they were walking along, she explained to Amaury that she was making a pilgrimage for her mother in Ireland, from whom she received bad news.That walk was more or less the beginning of a hopeless love relationship between Amaury and Madame de Coua\u00ebn, an affair in which his respect for the marquis and the true love of Madame de Coua\u00ebn for her husband left him with the sole possibility of platonic adoration. To escape such a situation, he attempted to retire as a hermit on a nearby deserted island once inhabited by Druids, but after spending only one night there, he abandoned that project. He then decided to go to Ireland on a boat that brought the marquis some secret dispatches; he would see Madame de Coua\u00ebn\u2019s mother and possibly establish some useful political connections for the marquis. As he embarked, after leaving a letter of explanation in his room, Madame de Coua\u00ebn came running to the beach with word that her mother just died. While he tried to comfort her she tearfully begged him never to get married but to stay with them, help her husband, and understand her as no one else can.The Marquis de Coua\u00ebn went to Paris for some political meetings and took his wife, son, and daughter with him to avoid raising suspicions. Amaury accompanied them to Paris. When they returned to Coua\u00ebn, they found the coast occupied by soldiers.Amaury went to see Am\u00e9lie, who was preparing to follow her grandmother to Normandy. When he insisted that they ought to delay for two years before making a decision concerning their future, Am\u00e9lie simply asked him to be prudent.On his way home, Amaury learned that the marquis was arrested in Paris; he rushed immediately to Coua\u00ebn to destroy some papers before the police officers would arrive there. Without objection or thanks, Madame de Coua\u00ebn accepted his help, and the next day they left for Paris with the two children. There Amaury communicated with Monsieur D. and Monsieur R. in an effort to secure their help.Meanwhile, the marquis was allowed to receive visitors, and his wife went to see him every day. Amaury spent every evening with her. At the same time, he was beginning to feel attracted to Madame R., a lonely and disillusioned woman who often visited Madame de Coua\u00ebn. Amaury also decided to experience physical love with a prostitute, but he accomplished his purpose with no real pleasure.In the midst of these circumstances, Amaury could see no future for himself. He became involved in a royalist conspiracy, more in an effort to find self-fulfillment in a chivalric cause than to satisfy any political convictions. Faced with imminent action, he realized that his position might endanger the future of the marquis, bring grief to Madame de Coua\u00ebn, and show ingratitude toward Monsieur R. and Monsieur D. Fortunately, his secret political involvement was never disclosed.When the marquis was sent to Blois, Amaury did not accompany his friends, although they wanted him to come with them. Left in Paris, he visited Madame R. and wrote to Blois, where the royalist political leaders were being tried. Madame R., while refusing to become his mistress, liked to be seen with him in public and demanded the most foolish proofs of his attachment. They never really trusted each other, and she was always jealous of his love for Madame de Coua\u00ebn.A letter from the marquis arrived, announcing the death of his son and the alarming state of his wife\u2019s health; the nobleman further asked for a two-week pass to bring her to Paris for medical attention. Madame de Coua\u00ebn, who considered the death of her son a punishment for her own weakness, was unhappy to discover the relationship between Amaury and Madame R.On a day when Am\u00e9lie came to visit Madame de Coua\u00ebn, Madame R. was also present, and Amaury realized that his instability caused the unhappiness of three women. Caught in his youth in the web of illegitimate love, he was unable to choose either true virtue or carefree disorder. He never saw Am\u00e9lie again.Back in Blois, Madame de Coua\u00ebn sent him a medallion of her mother and a souvenir of her son. Shortly afterward, he ended his affair with Madame R. Years later he heard that Monsieur R. received a post of importance and that Madame R. became the mother of a son. Thus reaching the bottom of a moral abyss, Amaury enlisted in the army with the idea of finding death on the battlefield; he arrived at Austerlitz only after the battle was won. Convinced that there was no place for him in society, he decided to become a priest.Several years later, after he took holy orders, he decided to visit again his uncle\u2019s farm and the castle at Coua\u00ebn. He received no news from Blois for several weeks, and he was afraid that Madame de Coua\u00ebn\u2019s health had not improved. On his arrival at Coua\u00ebn he was surprised to find a flurry of activity; his friends had returned the day before. Although Madame de Coua\u00ebn was very weak, she welcomed him warmly, adding that someone might soon need his assistance. As her condition became worse, Amaury administered the rites of absolution and extreme unction. Madame de Coua\u00ebn died soon afterward and was buried in the chapel of Saint-Pierre-de-Mer.This experience and the emotions it called forth proved extremely trying to Amaury, who immediately left Brittany and, a short time later, France. He hoped to find abroad some peace in obscure but useful activities.", "author": "Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve"},
{"title": "Volpone", "summary": "\u00a0 Volpone and his servant, Mosca, are playing a cunning game with all who profess to be Volpone\u2019s friends, and the two conspirators boast to themselves that Volpone acquired his riches not by the common means of trade but by a method that cheated no one in a commercial sense. Volpone has no heirs. Since it is believed he possesses a large fortune, many people are courting his favor in the hope of rich rewards after his death.\u00a0For three years, while Volpone feigns gout, catarrh, palsy, and consumption, valuable gifts are given to him. Volpone is in truth quite healthy and able to enjoy various vices. Mosca\u2019s role in the grand deception is to assure each hopeful, would-be friend that he is the one whom Volpone honored in an alleged will.To Voltore, one of the dupes, Mosca (which means \u201cfly\u201d) boasts that particular attention is being paid to Voltore\u2019s interests. When Voltore (\u201cvulture\u201d) leaves, Corbaccio (\u201ccrow\u201d) follows. He brings a potion to help Volpone (\u201cfox\u201d), or so he claims. Mosca knows better than to give his master medicine from those who are awaiting the fox\u2019s death. Mosca suggests that to influence Volpone, Corbaccio should go home, disinherit his own son, and leave his fortune to Volpone. In return for this generous deed, Volpone, soon to die, will leave his fortune to Corbaccio, whose son will benefit eventually.Next comes Corvino, who is assured by Mosca that Volpone, now near death, named him in a will. After the merchant goes, Mosca tells Volpone that Corvino has a beautiful wife whom he guards at all times. Volpone resolves to go in disguise to see this woman.Sir Politic Would-Be and his wife are traveling in Venice. Another English visitor, Peregrine, meets Sir Politic on the street and gives him news from home. While the two Englishmen are trying to impress each other, Mosca and a servant come to the street and erect a stage for a medicine vendor to display his wares. Volpone, disguised as a mountebank, mounts the platform. While he haggles with Sir Politic and Peregrine over the price of his medicine, Celia appears at her window and tosses down her handkerchief. Struck by Celia\u2019s beauty, Volpone resolves to possess her. Meanwhile Corvino brutally scolds Celia and tells her that henceforth he will confine her to her room.Mosca goes to Corvino with news that physicians recommended that a healthy young girl sleep by Volpone\ufffd\ufffds side and that other men are striving to be the first to win Volpone\u2019s gratitude in this manner. Not to be outdone, Corvino promises that Celia will be sent to Volpone.Mosca also tells Bonario, Corbaccio\u2019s son, that his father is about to disinherit him. He promises to lead Bonario to a place where he can witness his father\u2019s betrayal.When Lady Politic Would-Be comes to visit Volpone, she is so talkative Volpone fears she will make him sick in truth. To relieve Volpone\u2019s distress, the servant tells the lady that Sir Politic is in a gondola with a young girl. Lady Would-Be hurries off in pursuit of her husband. Volpone retires to a private closet while Mosca leads Bonario behind a curtain so the young man can spy on Corbaccio. At that moment, eager to win favor with Volpone, Corvino arrives with Celia, and Mosca sends Bonario off to another room so he will not know of her presence. Meanwhile Corvino, who intends to deceive Celia about what he thinks is the true purpose of her lying with Volpone, tells Celia what she has to do to prove her chastity. To quiet her fears, and to guarantee the inheritance from Volpone, Corvino assures his distressed wife that Volpone is so decrepit he cannot harm her.When they are alone, Volpone leaps from his couch and displays himself as an ardent lover. As he is about to rape Celia, Bonario appears from his hiding place and saves her. While Mosca and Volpone, in terror of exposure, bewail their ruined plot, Corbaccio knocks. Volpone dashes back to his couch to assume his role of an invalid. As Mosca assures Corbaccio of Volpone\u2019s forthcoming death, Voltore enters the room and overhears the discussion. Mosca draws Voltore aside and assures the lawyer that he is attempting to get possession of Corbaccio\u2019s money so that Voltore will inherit more from Volpone. Mosca further explains that Bonario mistook Celia\u2019s visit and burst upon Volpone and threatened to kill him. Taken in by Mosca\u2019s lies, Voltore promises to keep Bonario from accusing Volpone of attempted rape and Corvino of villainy; he orders Bonario (who, unlike Volpone, Mosca, Corvino, Corbaccio, and Voltore, is innocent) arrested.Mosca proceeds with his case against Celia and Bonario. He assured Corvino, Corbaccio, and Voltore, independently, that each would be the sole heir of Volpone. He added Lady Would-Be as a witness against Celia. In court Voltore presents Celia and Bonario as schemers against Corvino, and he further shows that Bonario\u2019s father disinherited his son and that Bonario dragged Volpone out of bed and attacked him. Corvino and Corbaccio testify against Celia and Bonario, while Mosca whispers to the avaricious old gentlemen that they are helping justice. To add to the testimony, Mosca presents Lady Would-Be, who tells the court she saw Celia beguiling Sir Politic in a gondola. Mosca promises Lady Would-Be that as a reward for her testimony her name will stand first on Volpone\u2019s list of heirs.When the trial is over, Volpone sends his servants to announce that he is dead and that Mosca is his heir. While Volpone hides behind a curtain, Mosca sits at a desk taking an inventory of the inheritance as the hopefuls arrive. The next step in Volpone\u2019s plan is to escape from Venice with his loot. Mosca helps him disguise himself as a commodore. Mosca also puts on a disguise.Having lost his hopes for the inheritance, Voltore withdraws his false testimony at the trial, and Corbaccio and Corvino tremble lest their own cowardly acts be revealed. The court orders Mosca to appear. Suspecting that Mosca plans to keep the fortune for himself, the disguised Volpone goes to the court. When the dupes, learning that Volpone is still alive, begin to bargain for the wealth Mosca holds, Volpone throws off his disguise and exposes to the court the foolish behavior of Corbaccio, Corvino, and Voltore, and the innocence of Celia and Bonario. The court then sentences each conspirator according to the severity of his crime. Bonario is restored to his father\u2019s inheritance, and Celia is allowed to return to her father because Corvino attempted to barter her honor for wealth. The court announces that evil can go only so far before it kills itself.", "author": "Ben Jonson"},
{"title": "The Virginians", "summary": "\u00a0 Although Harry and George Warrington are twins, George is declared the heir to their father\u2019s estate by virtue of having been born half an hour before his brother. Both are headstrong lads, greatly pampered by their widowed mother, Rachel Esmond Warrington, who manages her Virginia estate, Castlewood, much as she managed the mansion in the old country. She never lets her sons forget their high birth, and she herself had dropped the name of Warrington in favor of her birth name, Esmond, so that everyone would remember her noble rank. Rachel is a dictator on her plantation, and although she is respected by many, she is loved by few.\u00a0Harry and George are trained according to the place and the time. They learn to ride, to shoot, and to gamble like gentlemen, but they have little formal education other than a small knowledge of Latin and French. Their mother hopes they might pattern themselves after Colonel George Washington, who is their neighbor and her close friend. Harry worships Washington from his youth to his death, but George and Colonel Washington are never to be friends.When General Braddock arrives from England to command the English troops in the war against the French, Washington and George join his forces. Although Harry is a better soldier, George represents the family because of his position as elder son. Braddock is defeated, and George is reported captured and killed by the French. George\u2019s mother blames Washington for not guarding her son, and Washington is no longer welcome at Castlewood.Upon George\u2019s death, Harry becomes the heir, and his mother sends him to visit his relatives in England. There he meets his mother\u2019s kinsman, Lord Castlewood; her half sister, Baroness Bernstein; and Will, Maria, and Fanny Esmond, his cousins. Of all of his relatives, only Baroness Bernstein is fond of him. Harry and Will are enemies from their first meeting, and the rest of the family thinks him a savage and tolerate him only because he will some day inherit the estate in Virginia. Harry thinks he is in love with Maria, who is his mother\u2019s age, and sends her many gifts and passionate letters declaring himself hers and asking for her hand in marriage.Harry is the toast of the country. He spends money lavishly on fine clothes and horses and at first wins thousands of pounds at cards; but when his luck turns and he loses all of his money, most of his former friends have only unkind words for him. Matters become so desperate that he is jailed for his debts, and Baroness Bernstein is the only one of his relatives who offers to help him. Nevertheless, there is a string attached to her offer. She is violently opposed to his intended marriage to Maria and will pay his debts only if he promises to break his word to that lady. Although Harry is tired of Maria, he feels it beneath a gentleman of his position to break his word, and he refuses the Baroness\u2019s help under her conditions. He would rather remain in prison.There his brother George finds him. George escaped from the French after eighteen months in prison and returned to his home in Virginia, where he and his mother decided that he, too, should visit England. He pays his brother\u2019s debts, and the two boys have a joyful reunion. Harry now has to return to his status as younger brother, and George assumes his place as heir to Castlewood in Virginia.Before Harry\u2019s imprisonment and George\u2019s arrival in England, Harry made the acquaintance of Colonel Lambert and his family. There were two daughters, Theo and Hetty, whom the twin brothers found charming. Theo and George fell in love, and after overcoming her father\u2019s objections, they were married. At first, they lived in poverty, for George spent all of his money to rescue Harry from debtors\u2019 prison and to buy for him a commission in the army. For a time, George\u2019s only income is from two tragedies he wrote, one a success and the other a failure.Shortly after Harry receives his commission, he joins General Wolfe and sails for America to fight the French in the colonies. Maria releases him from his promise to her, and he gladly takes leave of his English relatives. About this time, George inherits a title and an estate from an unexpected source. Sir Miles Warrington, his father\u2019s brother, dies; and young Miles Warrington, the only male heir, is killed in an accident; therefore, the title and the estate fall to George. He and Theo now live in comparative luxury. They travel extensively, and one day they decide to visit George\u2019s mother and brother in Virginia.When they arrive in America, they find the colonies to be in a state of unrest. The colonists are determined not to pay all the taxes that the British Crown levied against them, and there is much talk of war. There is also trouble at Castlewood. Harry marries Fanny Mountain, the daughter of his mother\u2019s housekeeper, and his mother refuses to accept the girl. Harry moves to his own smaller estate, but there is a great tension among the members of the family. George and Theo and their mother are loyal to the king. Harry becomes a true Virginian and follows General Washington into battle. Despite their different loyalties, the brothers remain friends.Shortly before the end of the war, George and Theo return to England. Although they are grieved at the outcome of the war, it makes little difference in their lives. Harry visits them in England after the death of his wife, but their mother never again leaves Virginia. George and Theo try to persuade Hetty to marry Harry, whom she once loved deeply, but she refuses to leave her widowed father. The only departure from their quiet life comes when Lord Castlewood tries to steal Castlewood in Virginia from their mother after her deed and title are burned during the war. George, however, is able to prevent the fraud and save the estate. Intending never to leave England again, he renounces his right to the Virginia land. Harry returns to Virginia, where he is made a general, to live out his life at Castlewood in the company of his mother. The brothers are destined never to meet again, but their love for each other goes with them throughout their lives.", "author": "William Makepeace Thackeray"},
{"title": "Villette", "summary": "\u00a0 As a young girl, Lucy Snowe visits her godmother, Mrs. Bretton, about twice each year. It is a warm, active household, and Lucy loves Mrs. Bretton. During one of Lucy\u2019s visits, young Polly Home, whose widowed father is leaving England for the Continent, comes to stay with the Brettons. Polly is mature and worldly for her years, and she develops a tender, almost maternal, fondness for Mrs. Bretton\u2019s son, Graham. Because Lucy shares a room with the young visitor, she becomes the recipient of her confidences. Polly\u2019s father had originally intended to send his daughter to Mrs. Bretton\u2019s home for an extended stay, but he becomes lonely for her and returns to take his daughter back to Europe with him. Lucy\u2019s visits with the Brettons come to an end when they lose their property and move away. After that, Lucy loses track of her godmother.\u00a0As a grown woman, Lucy earns her living by acting as a companion to elderly women. Tiring of her humdrum existence, she travels to France. There an unusual chain of circumstances leads her to the city of Villette and to a school run by Madame Beck and her kinsman, Monsieur Paul Emanuel. Owing to Lucy\u2019s calm disposition, ready wit, firm character, and cultivated intellect, she soon receives an appointment as instructor of English at the school.Attending the school is Ginevra Fanshawe, a pretty but flighty and selfish girl whose relationship with Lucy takes the form of a scornful friendship. Madame Beck is a clever schoolmistress. She conducts her school, which has both day students and boarders, through a system of spying that includes occasional furtive searches among the personal possessions of others and also a constant stealthy watching from her window. Despite Madame Beck\u2019s behavior, Lucy feels a firm respect for her. Her system is steady and unflagging. Monsieur Paul is a voluble and brilliant instructor. He always seems to be at Lucy\u2019s elbow admonishing her, tantalizing her intellect, attempting to lead her. Often, Lucy attributes the peculiar notions of the pair to their Catholicism, which Lucy abhors. Dr. John, a handsome, generous young practitioner who attends the school\u2019s students, is a general favorite at the institution. Although she does not betray her knowledge, Lucy recognizes him as the John Graham Bretton, whom she had known as a child.In her characteristically scornful and triumphant manner, Ginevra Fanshawe confides to Lucy that she has a pair of ardent suitors: Isidore, who, according to Ginevra, is madly in love with her, and Colonel de Hamal, whom Ginevra herself prefers. One night in the garden, Lucy finds a letter intended for someone at the school. Dr. John appears in time to assist Lucy in disposing of the missive before the spying Madame Beck can interfere. The young doctor apparently knows the person for whom the letter is intended. Some time later, Lucy learns that Ginevra\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Isidore is Dr. John himself, and that the nocturnal letter had been sent by de Hamal; Dr. John had been trying to protect his beloved. Dr. John confesses that he hopes to marry the schoolgirl.Alone at the school\u2019s dormitory during a vacation, Lucy is overcome by depression. She has been haunted in the past by the apparition of a nun, and the reappearance of this specter so exacerbates the already turbulent emotions of the young teacher that she flees into the streets of the town. There she wanders, driven to despair by her inner conflicts, until she comes to a Catholic church. Under a strange compulsion, she is led to make a confession to the priest, but she later regrets her action. While trying to find her way back to the school, she faints. Upon regaining consciousness, she finds herself in a room with familiar furnishings. She is in a Villette chateau occupied by her godmother, Mrs. Bretton, and Graham Bretton \u2014 the man known at the school as Dr. John. Graham, who is giving Lucy medical attention, for the first time recognizes her as the young girl who had so often stayed at his home in England.Lucy becomes a frequent visitor in the Bretton home. Before long, she realizes that she is in love with Dr. John. The warm friendship between the two young people is the subject of constant raillery by the sarcastic Monsieur Paul. While at a concert one evening with Dr. John and Mrs. Bretton, Lucy notices Ginevra in the audience. The schoolgirl begins to mimic Mrs. Bretton, and although the older woman is unaware of her actions, Dr. John is not. Quite suddenly, seeing how irreverently Ginevra can behave toward a woman as good as his mother, he realizes how weak and selfish the girl is, and his infatuation with her ends in disgust.At another concert he attends with Lucy, Dr. John rescues a young girl named Paulina Bassompierre from a rough crowd. Upon bringing her home, he discovers that she is in reality Polly Home. Repeated meetings between Polly, who is now called Paulina, and Dr. John foster the doctor\u2019s love for the girl who has loved him since childhood. Lucy, closing her eyes and ears to this grief, believes that Dr. John is lost to her. Fortunately, a new phase of life begins for her at the school. Madame Beck gives her greater freedom in her work, and Monsieur Paul shows a sincere interest in her mind and heart. The only flaw in Lucy\u2019s tranquillity is the reappearance of the apparition of the nun.One day, Madame Beck sends Lucy on an errand to the home of Madame Walravens. There Lucy is told a touching story about Monsieur Paul. In his youth, he loved a girl, Justine Marie, but her cruel relatives refused his suit and Justine subsequently died. Filled with remorse, Monsieur Paul undertook to care for Justine Marie\u2019s relatives. There survive old Madame Walravens and a priest, Father Silas, the same man to whom Lucy had confessed. The priest had been Monsieur Paul\u2019s tutor, and he is anxious to keep his former pupil from succumbing to the influence of Lucy, a heretic. Lucy\u2019s affection for Monsieur Paul grows, but her hopes are suddenly dashed when the truculent professor announces that he is leaving France for the West Indies. Madame Beck, always present when Monsieur Paul and Lucy meet, keeps the distraught young woman from talking to him. Ginevra Fanshawe has meanwhile eloped with de Hamal. A letter from the runaway girl explains Lucy\u2019s ghostly nun \u2014 de Hamal had thus attired himself when making nocturnal visits to Ginevra.On the eve of his sailing, Monsieur Paul arranges a meeting with Lucy to explain his sudden forced departure and recent silence. Surrounded by his possessive relatives, he has occupied his time with secret arrangements to make Lucy mistress of the school. To avoid the temptation of telling Lucy about his plans before they were consummated, he has remained apart from her. He promises that upon his return, in three years, he will rid himself of all his encumbrances so that he will be free to marry her.", "author": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb"},
{"title": "The Village", "summary": "\u00a0 The ancestors of Tikhon and Kuzma Ilitch Krasoff are nothing to be proud of: Their great-grandfather had been hunted from Durnovka with wolfhounds, their grandfather had distinguished himself by becoming a thief, and their father, a petty huckster, had died early in life as a result of his drinking. The sons, after serving for a time as clerks in town stores, take to the road as itinerant peddlers. After they travel together for many years, their partnership is mutually dissolved during an argument over the division of profits. The two part very bitterly.\u00a0After the partnership is broken, Tikhon takes over a posting station a few miles from Durnovka, the little village where his family has lived for many generations. Along with the station, he operates a liquor dispensary and general mercantile establishment. Determined to become a man of some consequence, he begins to build up his fortune although he is already in his forties. He decides to follow the tax collectors and buy land at forced sales, and he pays the lowest possible prices for what he purchases.Tikhon\u2019s private life is anything but rich. He lives with his cook, a mute woman, who becomes the mother of his child. The child, however, is accidentally smothered, and soon afterward Tikhon sends the woman away and marries a noblewoman, by whom he tries to have children. His efforts, however, are fruitless, for the children are always born premature and dead. As if to make up, temporarily at least, for his wife\u2019s failure to present him with children, fate gives Tikhon the opportunity of finishing off, economically speaking, the last member of the family that had held his own ancestors in serfdom through the previous centuries.Life is not easy for Tikhon. A government order closes all the dramshops, including his, and makes liquor a state monopoly. Tikhon also continues to be disturbed by the fact that he has no children, as he believes this indicates his failure in life.The summer following the government order closing his liquor business proves to be a bad one. There is no rain and it is very hot, so the grain harvest on his lands is only a fraction of what it should have been. During the fall, Tikhon goes to a fair to do some horse-trading, and while he is there he becomes disgusted with himself and with life in general, which suddenly seems pointless to him. He begins drinking heavily, downing immense quantities of vodka, although not enough to interfere with the conduct of his business.Tikhon\u2019s life is little affected by the war with Japan that breaks out soon afterward; he is more affected by persistent rumors of an attempt at a socialist revolution in the Russian legislative body. When he learns that the great landowners \u2014 those who own more than a thousand acres \u2014 are likely to have their estates taken from them for redistribution, he even begins to agitate a little for the new laws. Soon, however, he changes his mind when he discovers that the peasants on his own land are plotting against him. One Sunday, he hears that they are meeting at Durnovka to rise in rebellion against him. He immediately goes to the village, but the peasants refuse to listen to him and drive him away with force. The uprising is short-lived, and within a few days the peasants are back to deal with him again, but Tikhon no longer trusts them \u2014 he thinks of them as little better than treacherous animals.One of the workers on Tikhon\u2019s land is a young peasant named Rodka, who is married to a young girl of some beauty who is always called the Bride. The girl is a source of annoyance to Tikhon because she arouses him sexually. On several occasions she resists his unwelcome attentions, but finally he has his way with her. The Bride does not complain; she simply endures, much as she endures the terrible beatings that her husband administers to her with a whip. The beatings make Tikhon afraid of Rodka, and so he plots to do away with the peasant. Such scheming, however, proves unnecessary, for the Bride herself poisons her husband. Tikhon, at least, is sure that she has poisoned her husband, although no one else thinks so.Chance brings to Tikhon\u2019s attention a volume of poems written by his brother, Kuzma. Stirred by the knowledge that his brother is still alive and also an author, Tikhon writes him a letter, telling him that it is high time they buried their past differences and became friends again. Kuzma comes to Durnovka, and the two brothers become, at least on the surface, friendly. Tikhon offers his brother the overseership of the estate at Durnovka, and Kuzma accepts because he has no other prospects for earning a living.Kuzma Krasoff has done nothing with his life. Following the dissolution of his partnership with Tikhon years before, he worked here and there, as a drover, a teamster, a general worker. Then he fell in love with a woman at Voronezh and lived with her for ten years, until she died. In that decade, he busied himself by trading in grain and horses and by writing occasionally for the local newspaper. All of his life he has wanted to become a writer. He received no education, except for short periods of instruction at the hands of an unemployed shoemaker and from books he borrowed occasionally. He considers his life a complete waste, for he has never been able to settle down to writing seriously.In his maturity Kuzma blames all of his troubles, and the troubles of Russians in general, on a lack of education. He believes that education is the answer to every problem confronting him and his country, and he asserts that the Russians, whom he regards as little better than barbarians with a wide streak of hatred in their makeup, would be better folk if they were educated.Kuzma\u2019s life as overseer on his brother\u2019s estate is not a happy one. He feels that the position is a last resort, and he dislikes the people with whom he has to deal, including Tikhon. He is also perturbed by the Bride, whom Tikhon has sent to cook and keep house for him. She does not arouse him as she had aroused Tikhon, but Kuzma is bothered by her presence, and he feels extremely sorry for her because, a few years before, a group of men had raped her. That incident, Kuzma feels, lingers like a cloud over her existence. When at last he speaks to Tikhon about the matter, Tikhon, supposing that Kuzma has been sampling the same favors that he himself had enjoyed in the past, laughs at his brother\u2019s scruples. Nevertheless, he does arrange to marry off the woman, and the Bride becomes the wife of a peasant on the estate. On the wedding day, only Kuzma realizes that the prospect of a husband brings no joy to the Bride and that she, like himself, will never really be happy.", "author": "Ivan Bunin"},
{"title": "Vile Bodies", "summary": "\u00a0 During the rough English Channel crossing, almost everyone is in some stage of seasickness. Some become tipsy and take to their berths. The Bright Young People, led by Agatha Runcible and effeminate Miles Malpractice, strap themselves with sticking plaster and hope for the best. A few hardy souls gather in the smoking room where Mrs. Melrose Ape, a famous female evangelist traveling with her troupe of singing angels, bullies them into singing hymns. Father Rothschild, S.J., contemplates the sufferings of the saints.\u00a0Adam Fenwick-Symes, a young writer, is hurrying home to marry Nina Blount. To his dismay, the Dover customs authorities confiscate and burn the manuscript of the autobiography he wrote while in Paris. Almost as bad is the case of Agatha, who is stripped and searched after being mistaken for a notorious jewel smuggler.In London, Adam\u2019s publisher offers him a contract to write a novel, but with no advance in royalties. With only ten shillings to his name, Adam wonders how he is going to get married. Luckily, he is staying at Shepheard\u2019s Hotel. Lottie Crump, the proprietress, who bullies kings and advises members of Parliament, is careless about bills if she likes her guests. Most of her guests are drunk. One young man makes a foolish bet with Adam and loses a thousand pounds. Adam calls Nina and tells her they can get married immediately, but before he leaves the hotel a drunken major persuades him to put the money on the horse, Indian Runner, in the November Handicap. Then the major disappears, and Adam is forced to call Nina again and tell her that their marriage will be postponed.Adam and Nina go to Archie Schwert\u2019s costume party. Finding the affair dull, some of the Bright Young People go off to Lottie\u2019s for a drink. Judge Skimp, an American guest, is entertaining. One young woman, who fell while swinging on a chandelier, dies, despite the champagne used to bathe her forehead.The party is about to break up when Miss Brown invites the group to her house, which happens to be No. 10 Downing Street, for her father is Sir James Brown, the prime minister. Agatha stays all night because she had forgotten the key to her own house. The next morning, still in her Hawaiian grass skirt, she finds reporters and photographers waiting when she goes out the front door. Reports of midnight orgies at No. 10 Downing Street cause a change of government, and Mr. Outrage, whose dreams are filled with visions of nude Japanese ladies, becomes the new prime minister.On Nina\u2019s advice, Adam calls on Colonel Blount to ask if the eccentric gentleman can finance his daughter\u2019s wedding. The colonel generously gives him a check for a thousand pounds. Adam is jubilant and takes Nina to a country hotel where they stay overnight. He is so happy that she waits until the next morning to tell him that her father, an absentminded movie fan, signed Charlie Chaplin\u2019s name to the worthless check. The wedding is postponed once more.At Lady Metroland\u2019s party for Mrs. Ape, Baron Balcairn, a gossip columnist known as Mr. Chatterbox, shows up in disguise after the host refuses to send him an invitation. Suspected of spying on a secret political conference among Lord Metroland, Father Rothschild, and Mr. Outrage, he is exposed. Deciding to give his paper the scoop of scoops, he reports a sensational but false account of indiscreet confessions made by aristocrats whom the evangelist converted. Then he goes home, turns on the gas, puts his head into the oven, and quietly dies.Adam becomes Mr. Chatterbox. In the meantime, Balcairn\u2019s hoax swamps the courts with libel suits against the Daily Excess. Mrs. Ape confirms the story in a special interview and then departs with her angels to pep up religion at Oberammergau, Germany. Because Adam is forbidden to mention the names of those suing the paper, he is forced to invent fictitious people for his column. Among his creations is a man named Ginger, a model of fashion and a popular figure in society.He is rather surprised when he finally encounters Captain Eddy Littlejohn, a man whom everyone calls Ginger. Adam and Nina meet him at the November Handicap, where Indian Runner comes in first, paying thirty-five to one. A few minutes after the race, Adam spies the drunken major, but he disappears before Adam can push his way through the crowd to collect his winnings.Adam promises Nina that he will speak to her father again. He finds the colonel making a film based on the life of John Wesley and too busy to pay any attention to Adam. During his absence, Nina writes his column and mentions green bowlers, a fashion item that is taboo in the Daily Excess. As a result, Adam loses his job, and Miles becomes Mr. Chatterbox. Miles takes the post because he needs the money. His brother, Lord Throbbing, returns unexpectedly from Canada and throws Miles, along with his disreputable boxing and racing friends, out of Throbbing House.Adam, Agatha, Miles, and Archie Schwert go to the auto races where, to get into the pits, they wear brassards indicating that they belong to the crew of car 13. Between heats, Adam again meets the drunken major, who, after assuring him that his thirty-five thousand pounds are safe in the bank, borrows five pounds to make a bet.When the driver of car 13 is disabled by an Italian rival, Agatha, who wears a brassard designating her as a spare driver, takes the wheel. Careening madly, she establishes a course record for the lap before she leaves the track and drives across country until she crashes the car into a monument. She is found wandering about in a dazed condition and dies in a nursing home, still thinking that she is driving in a spinning world of speed and sound.Adam has no money to pay Lottie\u2019s bill for seventy-eight pounds sixteen and twopence. Meeting Ginger Littlejohn, he borrows that amount and promises in return that Ginger can marry Nina. Shortly after Ginger and Nina return from their honeymoon, Ginger is called up for military service. Adam and Nina spend Christmas with Colonel Blount. The Wesley film is finished, and the colonel, planning to show it as a Christmas treat, is too preoccupied to notice that his supposed son-in-law is a writer he met previously as Fenwick-Symes. On Christmas night, they hear that war was declared.Adam meets his drunken major again on a blasted battlefield during a lull in the fighting. The officer, who insists that he is now a general, announces that he lost his division. Adam is not quite so badly off; he loses only one platoon. The general offers to pay the thirty-five thousand pounds on the spot, but Adam thinks the money will be useless. They do find the general\u2019s car and in it are a case of champagne and Chastity, one of Mrs. Ape\u2019s singing angels. Adam drinks some of the wine and falls asleep, leaving the general and Chastity to entertain each other.", "author": "Evelyn Waugh"},
{"title": "Vanity Fair", "summary": "\u00a0 Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley become good friends while they are students at Miss Pinkerton\u2019s School for girls. It is proof of Amelia\u2019s good, gentle nature that she takes as kindly as she does to her friend, who is generally disliked by all the other girls. Amelia overlooks the indications of Becky\u2019s selfishness as much as she can. After the two girls finish their education at the school, Becky accompanies her friend to her home for a short visit. There she first meets Joseph Sedley, Amelia\u2019s older brother, called Jos, who is home on leave from military service in India. Jos is shy, unused to women, and certainly to women as designing and flirtatious as Becky. His blundering and awkward manners do not appeal to many women, but Becky is happy to overlook these faults when she compares them with his wealth and his social position. Amelia innocently believes that her friend fell in love with her brother, and she discreetly tries to further the romance.\u00a0To this end, she arranges a party at Vauxhall. Becky and Jos, along with Amelia and her admirer, George Osborne, are present. There is a fifth member of the group, Captain Dobbin, a tall, lumbering fellow, also in service in India. He was in love with Amelia for a long time, but he recognizes that dashing George is much more suitable for her. All the maneuvering of the flirtatious Becky and the amiable Amelia, however, is not sufficient to corner Jos, who drinks too much punch and believes that he made a silly figure of himself at the party. A day or so later, a letter delivered to the Sedley household announces that Jos is ill and plans to return to India as soon as possible.Since there is no longer any reason for Becky to remain with the Sedleys, she leaves Amelia, after many tears and kisses, to take a position as governess to two young girls at Queen\u2019s Crawley. The head of the household is Sir Pitt Crawley, a cantankerous old man renowned for his miserliness. Lady Crawley is an apathetic soul who lives in fear of her husband\u2019s unreasonable outbursts. Becky decides that she has nothing to fear from her timid mistress and spends most of her time ingratiating herself with Sir Pitt and ignoring her pupils. Becky also shows great interest in Miss Crawley, a spinster aunt of the family, who is exceedingly wealthy. Miss Crawley pays little attention to Sir Pitt and his children, but she is fond of Rawdon Crawley, a captain in the army and a son of Sir Pitt by a previous marriage. She is so fond of her dashing young nephew that she supports him through school and pays all of his gambling debts with only a murmur.During Becky\u2019s stay, Miss Crawley visits Sir Pitt only once, at a time when Rawdon is also present. The handsome young dragoon soon falls prey to Becky\u2019s wiles and follows her about devotedly. Becky also takes care to ingratiate herself with the holder of the purse strings. Miss Crawley finds Becky witty and charming and does not attempt to disguise her opinion that the little governess is worth all the rest of the Crawley household put together. Becky, therefore, finds herself in a very enviable position. Both Sir Pitt and his handsome son are obviously interested in her. Miss Crawley insists that Becky accompany her back to London.Becky is expected to return to her pupils after only a short stay with Miss Crawley; but Miss Crawley takes ill and refuses to allow anyone but her dear Becky to nurse her. Afterward, there are numerous other excuses to prevent the governess from returning to her duties. Certainly, Becky is not unhappy. Rawdon is a constant caller and a devoted suitor for Becky\u2019s hand. When the news arrives that Lady Crawley died, no great concern is felt by anyone. A few days later, however, Sir Pitt himself appears, asking to see Miss Sharp. Much to Becky\u2019s surprise, the baronet throws himself at her feet and asks her to marry him. Regretfully, she refuses his offer. She is already secretly married to Rawdon.Following this disclosure, Rawdon and his bride leave for a honeymoon at Brighton. Chagrined and angry, old Miss Crawley takes to her bed, changes her will, and cuts off her nephew without a shilling. Sir Pitt raves with anger. Amelia\u2019s marriage also precipitates a family crisis. Her romance with George proceeds with good wishes on both sides until Mr. Sedley loses most of his money through some unfortunate business deals. Then George\u2019s snobbish father orders his son to break his engagement to a penniless woman. George, whose affection for Amelia was never stable, is inclined to accept this parental command; but Captain Dobbin, who sees with distress that Amelia is breaking her heart over George, finally prevails upon the young man to go through with the marriage, regardless of his father\u2019s wishes. When the couple arrive in Brighton for their honeymoon, they find Rawdon and Becky living there happily in penniless extravagance.Captain Dobbin also arrives in Brighton. He agrees to act as intercessor with Mr. Osborne. Nevertheless, his hopes of reconciling father and son are shattered when Mr. Osborne furiously dismisses Captain Dobbin and takes immediate steps to disown George. Captain Dobbin also brings the news that the army is ordered to Belgium. Napoleon landed from Elba. The Hundred Days begins.In Brussels, the two couples meet again. George is infatuated with Becky. Jos, now returned from India, and Captain Dobbin are also stationed in that city; Captain Dobbin is in faithful attendance upon neglected Amelia. Everyone is waiting for the next move that Napoleon will make; but in the meantime, the gaiety of the duke of Wellington\u2019s forces is widespread. The Osbornes and Crawleys attend numerous balls. Becky, especially, makes an impression upon military society, and her coquetry extends with equal effect from general to private. June 15, 1815, is a famous night in Brussels, for on that evening the duchess of Richmond gives a tremendous ball. Amelia leaves the party early, brokenhearted at the attentions her husband shows Becky. Shortly after she leaves, the men are given orders to march to meet the enemy. Napoleon entered Belgium, and a great battle is impending.As Napoleon\u2019s forces approach, fear and confusion spread throughout Brussels, and many of the civilians flee the city, but Amelia and Becky do not. Becky is not alarmed, and Amelia refuses to leave while George is in danger. She remains in the city some days before she hears that her husband was killed. Rawdon returns safely from the Battle of Waterloo. He and Becky spend a merry and triumphant season in Paris, where Becky\u2019s beauty and wit gain her a host of admirers. Rawdon is very proud of their son.Amelia also has a child. She returned to London almost out of her mind with grief, and only after her son is born does she show any signs of rallying. When Becky grows bored with the pleasures of Paris, the Crawleys return to London. There they rent a large home and proceed to live well with little money. By this time, Becky is a master at this art, and so they live on a grander scale than Rawdon\u2019s small winnings at cards would warrant. Becky becomes acquainted with the nobility of England and makes a particular impression on rich old Lord Steyne. At last, all society begins to talk about young Mrs. Crawley and her elderly admirer. Fortunately, Rawdon hears nothing of this ballroom and coffeehouse gossip.Through the efforts of Lord Steyne, Becky eventually achieves her dearest wish, presentation at Court. Presented along with her is the wife of the new Sir Pitt Crawley. The old man died, and young Sir Pitt, his oldest son and Rawdon\u2019s brother, inherited the title. Since then, friendly relations were established between the two brothers. If Rawdon realizes that his brother also fell in love with Becky, he gives no sign, and he accepts the money his brother gives him with good grace; but more and more, he feels himself shut out from the happy life that Becky enjoys. He spends much time with his son, for he realizes that the child is neglected. Once or twice he sees young George Osborne, Amelia\u2019s son.Amelia struggles to keep her son with her, but her pitiful financial status makes it difficult to support him. Her parents grow garrulous and morose with disappointment over their reduced circumstances. At length, Amelia sorrowfully agrees to let Mr. Osborne take the child and rear him as his own. Mr. Osborne still refuses to recognize the woman his son married against his wishes, however, and Amelia rarely sees the boy.Rawdon is now deeply in debt. When he appeals to Becky for money, she tells him that she has none to spare. She makes no attempt to explain the jewelry and other trinkets she buys. When Rawdon is imprisoned for a debt, he writes and asks Becky to take care of the matter. She answers that she cannot get the money until the following day. An appeal to Sir Pitt, however, brings about Rawdon\u2019s release, and he returns to his home to find Becky entertaining Lord Steyne. Not long afterward, Rawdon accepts a post abroad, and he never returns to his unfaithful, scheming wife.Amelia\u2019s fortunes now improve. When Jos returns home, he establishes his sister and father in a more pleasant home. Mrs. Sedley dies, and Jos resolves to do as much as he can to make his father\u2019s last days happy. Captain Dobbin returns from India and confesses his love for Amelia. Although she acknowledges him as a friend, she is not yet ready to accept his love. It is Captain Dobbin who goes to Mr. Osborne and gradually succeeds in reconciling him to his son\u2019s wife. When Mr. Osborne dies, he leaves a good part of his fortune to his grandson and appoints Amelia as the boy\u2019s guardian.Amelia, her son, Captain Dobbin, and Jos took a short trip to the Continent. This visit is perhaps the happiest time in Amelia\u2019s life. Her son is with her constantly, and Captain Dobbin is a devoted attendant. Eventually, his devotion overcomes her hesitation and they are to be married. At a small German resort, they encounter Becky once more. After Rawdon left her, Becky was unable to live down the scandal of their separation. Leaving her child with Sir Pitt and his wife, she crossed to the Continent. Since then, she was living with first one considerate gentleman and then another. When she sees the prosperous Jos, she vows not to let him escape as he did before. Amelia and Jos greet her in a friendly manner, and only Captain Dobbin seems to regard her with distrust. He tries to warn Jos about Becky, but Jos is a willing victim of her charms.Becky travels with Jos wherever he goes. Although she cannot get a divorce from Rawdon, Jos treats her as his wife, and despite Captain Dobbin\u2019s protests, he takes out a large insurance policy in her name. A few months later, his family learns that he died while staying with Becky at Aix-la-Chapelle. The full circumstances of his death are never established, but Becky comes into a large sum of money from his insurance. She spends the rest of her life on the Continent, where she assumes the role of the virtuous widow and wins a reputation for benevolence and generosity.", "author": "William Makepeace Thackeray"},

{"title": "The Unvanquished", "summary": "\u00a0 During the Civil War, Colonel Sartoris comes home for a day to warn his family that Yankee soldiers are nearby and to help build a stock pen to hide his animals from the Yankees. A few days later, a Yankee soldier rides onto Sartoris land. The colonel\u2019s twelve-year-old son Bayard and his companion Ringo, a slave on the plantation, shoot at the soldier. The boys hide under Granny\u2019s skirts when more soldiers come to search the property for them. Granny denies that any children live on the property, and a colonel orders the rest of the men off the land while eyeing Granny\u2019s skirts. A family man himself, he leaves after telling Granny his name \u2014 Colonel Dick \u2014 and saying he hopes she will suffer nothing worse from the Northerners.\u00a0Later, advised by Colonel Sartoris, Granny leaves for Memphis because of the dangers of the war. Joby, the Colonel\u2019s servant, drives a wagon carrying Granny, Ringo, Bayard, and a trunk filled with silver that was buried in the yard for safekeeping. During the journey, Yankee soldiers steal their mules and Bayard and Ringo chase them unsuccessfully on a \u201cborrowed\u201d horse. Colonel Sartoris finds the boys and takes them home, capturing a Yankee camp on the way. Joby and Granny also make it back home with the help of \u201cborrowed\u201d horses, and the trunk containing the silver is again buried in the yard. Yankee soldiers come to capture Colonel Sartoris. True to a dream of Granny\u2019s, Loosh, Ringo\u2019s father, shows the Yankee soldiers where the trunk is buried. They take it and burn the house, but Sartoris escapes. Loosh and his wife Philadelphy leave because the Yankee soldiers tell them they are free.Granny, Ringo, and Bayard drive six days to Hawkhurst, Alabama, to recover their trunk, their mules, and the runaway slaves. On the journey, they pass hundreds of former slaves who are following the Yankee troops to freedom. At Hawkhurst, Granny\u2019s niece, Drusilla Hawk, joins the group, and the four of them travel to the river, where Yankee soldiers have built a bridge. After crossing, the soldiers hurry to destroy the bridge so the people who have followed them to freedom will be unable cross. The Sartoris wagon gets pushed into the river, and the four travelers make it to the other side, where the Yankee troops are now stationed.Granny asks to speak with Colonel Dick. She asks for the return of her mules, her trunk, and Loosh and Philadelphy. Colonel Dick gives Granny a written statement from the commanding general dated August 14, 1863, that validates the return of 10 chests, 110 mules, and 110 former slaves who are following the troops. The document allows them to pass safely through any Yankee troops they might encounter and also to petition them for food during the journey home.Once home, Granny, with the aid of Ringo and Ab Snopes, forges papers similar to the document given to her by Colonel Dick to requisition mules from various Yankee regiments in the area. She keeps the mules in the hidden pen on Sartoris property until she either sells them to other Yankee units or gives them to neighbors impoverished by the war. Near the end of the war, just before the Yankee troops leave the South, they discover Granny\u2019s activities. The Yankees, acting on information from Ab Snopes, take back all the mules still in the Sartoris pen. Snopes then talks Granny into one last deal, getting valuable horses from Southern raiders. Although Ringo and Bayard try to stop Granny, she goes to the raiders and is killed. After Granny\u2019s funeral, Uncle Buck McCaslin rides with Ringo and Bayard to find Grumby, the man responsible for Granny\u2019s death. For months, they track the raiders. When they are close, Uncle Buck leaves the boys because of a gunshot wound he has suffered during the chase. In a fight, the boys kill Grumby; they then nail his body to the compress where Granny was killed and bring Grumby\u2019s right hand back to place on Granny\u2019s grave.Drusilla, having fought alongside Sartoris and his troops, returns from the war with the colonel and works with Ringo, Bayard, and Joby to regenerate the land while Sartoris works in Jefferson, four miles away. Drusilla\u2019s mother and the women of Jefferson are outraged that Drusilla camped with the widower Sartoris during the war and has now returned to live on his land. They insist that Drusilla and Sartoris marry and unknowingly set election day as the day of the wedding. Drusilla sets out for Jefferson to meet Sartoris and marry him but gets involved in the politics of election day. Sartoris kills two men who are trying to get an African American elected marshall; he appoints Drusilla voting commissioner, and the white men return with Drusilla to the Sartoris land to vote against the African American candidate. In the excitement, Drusilla forgets to get married.About eight years later, Bayard is in his third year studying law in Oxford, Mississippi. Ringo comes to him to report that John Sartoris has been killed by his rival, Ben Redmond. On the forty-mile ride home, Bayard reflects on the last few years: his father\u2019s marriage to Drusilla and the code of violence to which they adhere, his father\u2019s railroad venture with Redmond, their run against each other for political office, his father\u2019s humiliating taunting of Redmond, and his father\u2019s recent decision to turn against killing and meet Redmond unarmed. Bayard knows Drusilla and the men in Jefferson will expect him to avenge his father\u2019s death. Bayard, who cannot forget the death of Grumby, realizes that killing is not a satisfactory solution. Determined neither to kill again nor to be a coward, he goes to Jefferson the next day to meet Redmond unarmed. Redmond shoots twice, intentionally missing Bayard, and leaves town. Bayard returns home and finds that Drusilla has gone to live with her brother but has left behind a sprig of verbena for him.", "author": "William Faulkner"},

He observes a notorious massacre in which the Baptists are annihilated because they refuse to carry the weapons of war into battle.After the battle, Jack meets the earl of Surrey, who is on the Continent at the time. Surrey was acquainted with Jack at King Henry\u2019s court and is glad to see him again. He confides to Jack his love for Geraldine, a lovely Florentine woman. Surrey proposes that Jack travel with him to Italy to find her. Since Jack has no other immediate plans, he readily consents to accompany the earl.Jack and Surrey proceed southward into Italy. As they travel, Surrey proposes to Jack that they exchange identities for a time, so that the nobleman can behave in a less seemly fashion. Pleased at the prospect of being an earl, even temporarily, Jack agrees.Upon their arrival in Venice, the two are taken up by a courtesan named Tabitha, who tries to kill the man she thinks is the earl of Surrey, using the true earl as her accomplice. Surrey and Jack turn the tables on her, however, and cause her and her pander to be executed for attempting to conspire against a life. In the process, however, Jack unknowingly comes into possession of some counterfeit coins. When they use the money, Jack and the earl are seized as counterfeiters and are sentenced to death.While in prison awaiting execution, Jack meets Diamante, the wife of a goldsmith; her husband has imprisoned her because he suspects her of infidelity. Jack has sex with Diamante after assuring her that by doing so she is avenging herself on a husband who does not believe in her chastity.After a few weeks in prison, Jack and the earl are released; an English gentleman who had heard of their plight had secured the efforts of the poet Aretine to prove to the court that Tabitha and her procurer were the counterfeiters. Aretine also sees to it that Diamante is released from prison. She continues to be Jack\u2019s mistress, and within a few weeks, after her husband dies of the plague, Jack marries her.Jack decides to travel, and he and Diamante leave the earl of Surrey in Venice. Jack takes such pleasure from bearing the nobleman\u2019s title, however, that he continues to do so. After some time, Surrey hears that there is another earl by the same name and goes to investigate. Learning that the double is Jack, Surrey forgives him, and they once again resume their interrupted trip to Florence. Upon arriving there, the earl issues a challenge to all the knights and gentlemen of the city; he hopes thereby to prove his love for Geraldine. The tournament is a great success, and Surrey carries off all the honors of the day. After that, Surrey and Jack part company, and Jack, still accompanied by Diamante, goes on to Rome.In Rome, Jack and Diamante live with Johannes and Heraclide de Imola. During the summer, Signor de Imola dies of the plague. Shortly after his death, and before his corpse can be removed from the house, bandits break in and rape Heraclide de Imola and Diamante. Jack is overpowered by the bandits and unable to help the women. Heraclide kills herself after the attack. When police arrive at the house, they blame Jack for what has happened. He is unable to clear himself because the only other witness is Diamante, whom the bandits have kidnapped.A banished English earl appears in time to save Jack from the hangman\u2019s noose by producing witnesses to a deathbed confession made by one of the bandits. Jack is released and goes in search of Diamante. While searching for her, he falls through an unbarred cellar door into the house of a Jew, where he finds Diamante making love to an apprentice. The Jew, roused by the noise of the fall and Jack\u2019s angry shouting at Diamante, comes into the cellar and accuses them both of breaking into his house and corrupting his apprentice. Under the law, they become the Jew\u2019s bond servants. Jack is turned over to another Jew, the pope\u2019s physician, to be used in a vivisection.He is saved from this horrid death when one of the pope\u2019s mistresses falls in love with him and uses her influence to secure him for herself. Diamante also falls into the woman\u2019s hands. Jack and Diamante keep their previous relations a secret and wait for a chance to escape from the woman\u2019s house. One day, while the woman is away at a religious festival, they run off, taking with them as much loot as they can carry.Traveling northward, Jack goes to Bologna. There he witnesses the execution of a famous criminal, Cutwolfe, who had confessed to murdering the bandit who led the assault on Heraclide de Imola and Diamante months before. Moving on into France, Jack finds the English armies once again in the field, and he returns to King Henry\u2019s service.", "author": "Thomas Nashe"},
{"title": "Under Two Flags", "summary": "\u00a0 Although a fashionable member of his London set and an admirable fellow in every other respect, the Honorable Bertie Cecil of the First Life Guards is uncommonly low on credit. No moneylender in London will accept his note after he has mortgaged his whole inheritance. In these circumstances, he stakes everything on winning a race with his six-year-old horse, Forest King. With good-humored generosity, he nevertheless lends his younger brother, Berkeley, fifty pounds. The following day, he rides Forest King to victory over a difficult course and receives the praise of his Lady Guinevere, a fashionable peeress.\u00a0His father, Lord Royallieu, lives in the same mortgaged splendor that he has taught his three sons to enjoy. Lord Royallieu loves two of his sons but not Bertie, who looks too much like his dead wife\u2019s lover and, to the old viscount\u2019s detestation, carries the dead lover\u2019s name. The old man takes every occasion to sneer at Bertie\u2019s extravagance, and one day, he reveals his suspicion that Bertie is really the son of Alan Bertie.Bertie is otherwise lucky in the world. Sought after by half the women in London, he carries on flirtations with many. Lady Guinevere is one of his conquests. Rake, his valet, is devoted to him. Bertie salvaged Rake from a bad scrape in the army and has always treated him with friendly decency.Bertie is disturbed by his financial affairs, so his head groom promises to drug Forest King for a fee. When it is learned that Forest King was drugged before a race in Baden, Bertie\u2019s friends, far from blaming him, pretend to agree that the horse was merely ill; nevertheless, Bertie feels disgraced.Bertie\u2019s best friend, Lord Rockingham, is known to his comrades of the Guards as the Seraph. While Lord Rockingham is attempting to discover the mystery of Forest King\u2019s condition, he receives a report that Bertie Cecil has forged the Seraph\u2019s name to a note. Bertie cannot deny the charge, for the note was presented at a time when he was dining with Lady Guinevere. Wishing to protect her name from scandal, Bertie allows himself to be accused. He knows that his brother forged the note, and he hopes to protect Berkeley\u2019s name as well; consequently, Bertie leaves Europe suddenly to escape arrest.Accompanied by Rake, Bertie makes his escape on Forest King. Rake discovered that the groom had drugged Forest King, and he has pummeled him for it. He and his master ride to a place of safety, and then Bertie orders Rake to take Forest King to Lord Rockingham. He waits in hiding for a time, hoping Lady Guinevere will save him by telling of his whereabouts when the forged note was presented. She chooses to keep silent, however, holding her reputation at greater worth than Bertie\u2019s name.At last, by a mere throw of the dice in Algeria, Bertie decides to cast his lot with the French Foreign Legion instead of with the Arab cause. The faithful Rake accompanies him. Back in England, it is believed that Bertie has died in a French train wreck. Rockingham has Forest King; the old viscount burns Bertie\u2019s picture.Using the name Louis Victor, Bertie makes his mark with his new companions in the Foreign Legion. They marvel at his skill with horses, at his bravery, and at his brilliance in conversation. Bertie is a twelve-year veteran Legionnaire when he receives, six months late, the news that his father has died at the age of ninety. His older brother has inherited the viscount\u2019s title.Cigarette, a woman of independent spirit and a dancer and singer for the troops, comes to understand and admire Bertie. She warns him against Colonel Chateauroy, who hates Bertie because of his gallant record and popularity, and asks him never to disobey any of the colonel\u2019s unreasonable commands. Partly because he pities her, Bertie promises. Shortly afterward, Cigarette saves Bertie\u2019s life when he is in danger from some drunken Arabs. She adores him, but he is indifferent toward her.Bertie spends his spare time carving chessmen of ivory and walnut. Through this occupation, he meets the lovely Princess Corona d\u2019Amag\u00fce, a woman who had been unhappily married to a man injured while saving her brother\u2019s life. Her husband died soon after, and the princess has felt responsible for his death. Bertie soon falls in love with Princess Corona.Colonel Chateauroy makes it clear that he will never permit Bertie to be promoted above the rank of corporal. Bertie learns that Rake has purposely been getting himself into trouble to prevent his own promotion, for he does not wish to outrank his master. One day, Bertie reads in an old English journal that his older brother has died suddenly and that Berkeley has become Viscount Royallieu.The regiment is ordered out. In the gory fighting that follows, Cigarette saves the day when she arrives at the head of a fresh squadron of cavalry. She finds Bertie on the battlefield; he has been badly wounded. In the tent to which she has him carried, Bertie begins to talk incoherently while Cigarette sits beside him. Everything she hears him say makes her more jealous of the princess. She also learns that Bertie is English. No French person ever hated the English more than she. At her request, Bertie is not told who brought him back from the battlefield and cared for him during his sick ravings.Three weeks later, Bertie is startled when the Seraph comes as an English tourist to visit the Legion camp. Bertie does not wish to encounter his former friend, so he asks for and receives permission to carry dispatches through hostile territory to another Legion post. With the faithful Rake, he rides away on a mission that means almost certain death. Rake is killed in an Arab ambush, but Bertie delivers his dispatches safely. On his return trip, he stops at an inn and there sees his brother Berkeley, who is one of a party of tourists traveling with Princess Corona. Bertie gives no sign of recognition; he merely spurs his horse and continues on.Berkeley follows Bertie, however, and catches up with his older brother. Berkeley reveals his fear that Bertie might claim the title. Indifferent to all except Berkeley\u2019s selfishness, Bertie asks his brother to leave Algeria at once. Shortly afterward, Bertie discovers that Princess Corona is really the younger sister of the Seraph. She also becomes aware of Bertie\u2019s real name and insists that he make himself known to her brother. She begs him to claim his title, but he refuses.Princess Corona asks Cigarette to tell Bertie that the Seraph is looking for his former friend. In another interview with Bertie, the princess asks him to tell his story and let the world be the judge. As Bertie leaves her tent, he is intercepted by Colonel Chateauroy, who insults the princess. In a sudden rage, Bertie strikes his superior officer. He is subsequently arrested and sentenced to death.When Cigarette hears about Bertie\u2019s fate, she forces Berkeley, whom she has met accidentally, to acknowledge that Bertie is in reality his brother, an exile for Berkeley\u2019s crime and the true heir to the estate of Royallieu. She carries her story to a marshal of France and demands that Bertie\u2019s honor be saved although his life is already to be forfeited. With a stay of execution signed by the marshal, Cigarette rides at full speed to reach the Legion camp before the hour set for Bertie\u2019s execution.The Seraph, not Cigarette, reaches Bertie first. Despite the Seraph\u2019s entreaties, Colonel Chateauroy refuses to delay the time of execution. Cigarette reaches the spot just as the firing squad fires its volley, and with her own body, she takes the bullets intended for Bertie. She dies, but the marshal\u2019s order is safely delivered. A child of the army and a soldier of France, Cigarette has given her life to save a comrade. It is a sacrifice that Bertie and Princess Corona, happily reunited, are never to forget. In the end, Bertie is even reunited with Forest King.", "author": "Ouida"},
{"title": "Under the Volcano", "summary": "\u00a0 On November 2, 1939, the Mexican Day of the Dead, Jacques Laruelle, a French film producer, is ready to leave Quauhnahuac, Mexico. Before leaving, Laruelle joins his friend Dr. Vigil, and the two talk about their common acquaintance, Geoffrey Firmin, former British consul to Quauhnahuac, who was murdered exactly one year earlier.\u00a0After his visit with Dr. Vigil, Laruelle walks toward the Casino de Silva and recalls that day a year before. His recollections lead Laruelle to remember the time he spent with Geoffrey and his half brother, Hugh, at the Taskersons\u2019s home when all three were youngsters. One memory moves to another, and the story of Geoffrey and Hugh\u2019s childhood is told.Laruelle stops at the Cervecer\u00eda XX, where he chats with Se\u00f1or Bustamente, owner of the bar and neighboring cinema. Bustamente tells Laruelle that he suspects that the dead consul might have been a spy, or \u201cspider.\u201d At the end of their conversation, Bustamente gives Laruelle the copy of Elizabethan plays that Laruelle borrowed from Geoffrey. Laruelle intended to create a French version of the Faustus story. As he thumbs through the book, Laruelle finds a letter that Geoffrey wrote to his estranged wife, Yvonne, attempting to talk her into returning to him. Geoffrey never mailed the letter. When Laruelle leaves the bar, he walks up the Calle Nicaragua and remembers the day when Geoffrey was murdered and Yvonne was trampled to death by a horse.On the morning of the 1938 Day of the Dead, Geoffrey did not sleep and sat in the cantina drinking. Unexpectedly, Yvonne, the consul\u2019s former wife, appeared. She left Quauhnahuac the year before for America, where she secured a divorce from Geoffrey. Almost as unexpected was the return of the consul\u2019s half brother and Yvonne\u2019s lover, Hugh. Hugh returned because he felt that he could not stay away without suffering the pains of guilt that Yvonne suffered.After their reunion, Geoffrey, Yvonne, and Hugh left on a trip to Tomal\u00edn. Their trip was interrupted when they stopped by the home of Laruelle. Laruelle was one of Yvonne\u2019s former lovers, and the stopover caused much distress for Geoffrey because of Yvonne and Hugh\u2019s new closeness. Geoffrey drank several tequilas. Hugh and Yvonne went to a fiesta.When the consul awakened from his drunken sleep, he was addressed by two beings. An evil angel urged him to drink rather than think of Yvonne. At the same time, a good angel made threats about his drinking. This was the first connection between Geoffrey and the Faustus story that Laruelle proposed. The evil angel won when Geoffrey turned to drink because he felt that he could not successfully perform his duties as a husband.When Hugh and Yvonne returned from the fiesta, Hugh joked that perhaps his brother was a black magician. Hugh acted as a deterrent to any chances of Yvonne and Geoffrey ever getting back together. Hugh took Yvonne for a horseback ride. On the ride, Hugh identified himself with Judas because he felt that he betrayed his brother. When Hugh and Yvonne returned, they found Geoffrey awake, and the three continued their journey.The trip to Tomal\u00edn was interrupted when the travelers noticed a wounded Indian. Mexican law and possible repercussions influenced the group not to make an effort to assist the wounded man. Geoffrey saw a fellow traveler rob the dying man. Geoffrey and Hugh argued about the rationality of not helping the man. None of the three travelers was decisive. Hugh and Yvonne were indecisive because of the law, and Geoffrey was indecisive because he was more concerned about finding the next cantina for a drink.The travelers stopped and went to the Salon Ofelia for a drink. In the salon, Geoffrey\u2019s feelings erupted into a storm of violent words thrown at Yvonne and Hugh, accusing them of crimes against marriage and against brotherhood. Geoffrey drank mescal, which he earlier associated with his demise. While drinking the mescal, Geoffrey remembered a similar time when he drank all night and was supposed to meet a lady, Lee Maitland, who failed to arrive. To his surprise, he could not remember exactly who this lady was. Geoffrey was losing control of his perception of reality.Geoffrey saw his doom symbolized in the nearby volcano. He showed himself to be a Faustian character by broadcasting that he loved hell and could not wait to return there. He then rushed out of the Salon Ofelia as if in pain. Yvonne and Hugh rushed after him and tried to catch up with him. Although Geoffrey had damned them for their adultery, Yvonne and Hugh knew that they had to get him back to Quauhnahuac. They took the wrong path.As they pursued Geoffrey, Hugh and Yvonne visited several cantinas, looking for him. At each cantina they had a drink before going on. They eventually found themselves wandering around in the forest. As they wandered around, they heard a distant shot, not knowing that it was the sound of Geoffrey\u2019s execution by Mexican officials. Drunk, Yvonne tripped and fell over a log, and she was trampled by a horse that escaped from Geoffrey. Hugh wandered through the woods singing a revolutionary song and accompanying himself on a guitar.As he lay dying, Geoffrey imagined that he heard Laruelle and Dr. Vigil back in Quauhnahuac trying to comfort the grieving Yvonne and Hugh. When his hallucination was complete, Geoffrey screamed and died. Someone threw a dead dog into the ravine with the dead Englishman.", "author": "Malcolm Lowry"},

The two friends ask Dave Gellman, a teacher and philosopher, if they can stay with him, but Dave will only agree to allow Finn, and his and Jake\u2019s baggage, to remain. Jake, Dave says snidely, has to make other arrangements with a lady friend. Finn suggests Jake ask Anna Quentin, Jake\u2019s former girlfriend.\u00a0Though Jake has not seen or heard from Anna in years, he finds her easily once he starts looking. However, Anna will only let him stay one night, but suggests that he contact her sister, Sadie, who is looking for a caretaker for her place while she is away. Anna promises to contact Jake if she should need him.The next day, Sadie agrees to let Jake watch her flat. She is especially concerned about the unwanted attentions of Hugo Belfounder, Jake\u2019s former roommate. As roommates, the two had had many philosophical discussions, one of which Jake turned into a not-very-successful novel, The Silencer. In the novel, Jake had attempted to replicate one particular conversation with Hugo that dealt with language as the falsifier of experience. Jake feared his novel had betrayed Hugo\u2019s ideas, so he ended their friendship by not meeting him one night as planned.Reminded of all this, Jake returns to Madge\u2019s to pick up her copy of The Silencer. Instead, he runs into Sammy Starfield, a bookie who thinks he has stolen Madge from Jake. He offers Jake money as compensation, but Jake refuses. Instead, he allows Sammy to bet money on the horses and, should they win, give the winnings to Jake.On Tuesday, Jake reports to Sadie\u2019s flat. As soon as she leaves, the phone rings. The caller is Hugo. Jake identifies himself, but Hugo hangs up. Jake decides to track Hugo down, even though Sadie had told him not to leave the flat. Jake finds that he is locked in. Luckily, Dave and Finn are walking down the street. They find Jake\u2019s situation hilarious, but agree to get him out.Finn picks the lock, and the three set off to find Hugo at the address Sadie had for him. There they find a note saying Hugo is at a nearby pub \u2014 but the note does not say which pub. They never find Hugo, but they do find Lefty Todd, leader of the Independent Socialists. Lefty and Jake have a political discussion until the pub closes. The group walks to the Thames River, and everyone but Dave strips for a swim. More drinking follows. Finally, Lefty leaves, and Finn passes out. Suddenly, Dave remembers that he has a note for Jake. The note, a couple days old now, is from Anna, asking Jake to see her at once. Afraid he is too late, Jake hurries to Anna\u2019s mime theater.Finding the theater empty, Jake spots a truck containing Anna\u2019s things. A note attached to the neck of a rocking horse has Jake\u2019s initial on it. Anna has had an offer and could wait no longer for Jake. At this upsetting news, Jake jumps from the truck and goes to Hyde Park, where he passes out in the grass.Jake wakes up and returns to Sadie\u2019s to retrieve her copy of his novel. There, he eavesdrops on Sadie and Sammy, who are plotting to sell Jake\u2019s translation of novelist Jean Pierre\u2019s book The Wooden Butterfly to Hugo\u2019s film company. Jake decides he must go to Sammy\u2019s flat to retrieve his translation. He calls Finn to help him. At Sammy\u2019s place, they find Mister Mars, a movie dog, but not Jake\u2019s translation. Jake decides to kidnap the dog to exchange him for the translation.Finn returns to Dave\u2019s place, and Jake sets off for the Bounty Belfounder film studio with Mister Mars, intending to find Hugo and warn him about Sadie and Sammy\u2019s plot. Jake tricks his way into the well-guarded studio, where a labor rally led by Lefty Todd is in progress. Hugo is listening to Lefty and will not talk to Jake. A riot ensues, and the police show up. Worried that he will be arrested for stealing Mister Mars, Jake gets the dog to play dead and then uses the sympathy of the crowd for the poor limp dog and his owner to escape the scene.Back at Dave\u2019s flat, Jake finds several letters that have arrived for him. One contains money from Sammy for the bets he had placed a few days earlier. In the face of Sammy\u2019s honorable act, Jake decides to contact him about the dog. However, Dave and Finn have already contacted Sammy to protect themselves from implication after seeing a picture of Jake and Mister Mars in a newspaper article about the riot. Dave accuses Jake of impulsive behavior but is interrupted when a telegram arrives for Jake from Madge with money and directions to meet her in Paris. Jake leaves Mister Mars with Dave and leaves immediately.Once in Paris, Jake learns Madge has purchased all of Jean Pierre\u2019s works for film, including the book that Sammy and Sadie had been eager to purchase after reading Jake\u2019s translation. Madge wants to put Hugo\u2019s film studio out of business and wants to hire Jake as her script writer. She claims to love Jake and says she wants to help him have what he has always wanted: \u201cmoney for doing nothing.\u201d Jake turns her down, and the offer leaves him depressed.Outside, Jake gets caught up in national celebrations. Remembering the times he and Anna had shared in Paris, he suddenly thinks he sees her and then follows her. He finally catches up to the woman but finds she is not Anna after all. His entire life seems to be an illusion.Back in London, Jake returns to Dave\u2019s flat and goes to bed. In Jake\u2019s absence, Finn has disappeared.

One afternoon, Hugo is brought in my ambulance after getting hit on the head with a brick at a Lefty Todd rally. Jake believes that fate has brought Hugo to him and is determined to take the opportunity to talk to him.From Hugo, Jake learns that Hugo loves Sadie but Sadie does not love him in return. Instead, it is Anna who loves Hugo. Also, though Sadie might love Jake, Jake loves Anna. Hugo declares the situation hopeless and demands that Jake help him escape immediately from the hospital. Jake warns Hugo about the plot on his studio, but Hugo does not care about that. He is giving up the studio to become a watchmaker, a job for which he says he has a talent. As they escape, Jake is spotted by his supervisor and knows he will be fired.Once Jake and Hugo part ways, Jake realizes that everything has changed for him because all his assumptions have been false.

{"title": "Under the Greenwood Tree", "summary": "\u00a0 On Christmas Eve, the Mellstock Choir prepares to set out for its annual caroling venture. In fine voice, mellowed by generous mugs of cider, the men and boys gather at the home of Reuben Dewy. Then, with their fiddles and the cello of Grandfather Dewy, they depart on their rounds. After calling at outlying farms and houses, they arrive at the schoolhouse to serenade the new schoolmistress, Fancy Day. At first, there is no indication that she has heard them; but at last, she appears, framed, picture-like, in a window. Later, the men miss young Dick Dewy. When they find him, he is leaning against the school, staring up listlessly at the now-darkened window.\u00a0At church the following morning, Fancy Day causes a stir of excitement. She is the main attraction for Dick Dewy, Farmer Shiner, and the new vicar, Mr. Maybold, but she does not endear herself to a number of other men in the congregation because she commits what they regard almost as blasphemy. For as long as anyone can remember, the male choir has provided music for the service, but the young woman, on her first day in church, leads the young girls in singing along with the men. Some of the older and wiser ones foresee trouble from a woman who is so forward.Dick gives his annual party on the afternoon and evening of Christmas Day. When Dick can claim Fancy for a dance, he is transported with joy; but when she dances with Shiner, a more handsome and more wealthy man, Dick is downcast. When Shiner escorts the lady home, the evening is ruined for young Dick.Using a handkerchief left behind by Fancy as his excuse, Dick finds the courage to call at the schoolhouse a few days later. A very inexperienced lover, he simply returns the handkerchief, stammers a \u201cgood day,\u201d and departs. It is not until spring that he makes any real progress in his love affair. By that time, Dick is a wan and shadowy figure of a man. He speaks to no one of his love, but it is obvious to all but Fancy and her other two admirers that Dick is not himself.Before Dick can declare himself, however, a delegation from the choir waits on Vicar Maybold. The delegation has been made uneasy by a rumor that the group is to be displaced by organ music played by Fancy Day; soon, the choir learns that the rumor is true. The vicar has brought an organ to the church because he prefers that instrument to a choir. To spare the feelings of the faithful choir members, however, he agrees to wait before deposing them. They are to have the dignity of leaving on a special day, not on an ordinary Sunday.Dick\u2019s big day comes when he is allowed to bring Fancy and some of her belongings from the home of her father. He is dismayed to find Farmer Shiner also present, but when Fancy allows him to touch her hand at the dinner table, Dick\u2019s spirits rise perceptibly. On the ride home, he cannot find the words that are in his heart; he feels, nevertheless, that he has made some progress. In the weeks that follow, rumors of Fancy\u2019s friendliness with Maybold and with Shiner drive Dick to desperation. One day, he writes Fancy a letter in which he bluntly asks whether he means anything to her. When he receives no answer from Fancy, he resolves that he will talk to her next Sunday.Before Sunday comes, however, Dick has to go on an errand for Maybold\u2019s mother, taking him to a neighboring town. He is preparing to leave for home again when he sees Fancy waiting for the carrier. Seizing the opportunity, Dick helps her into his cart and triumphantly carries her off. On the drive home, he finally finds the courage to propose to her and is as much surprised as overjoyed to hear her acceptance.Because they will not be able to marry for some time, Dick and Fancy keep their betrothal a secret. Furthermore, Fancy\u2019s father has told her that he hopes she will accept Shiner for a husband. One trait of Fancy\u2019s character troubles Dick. She seems to take undue pleasure in dressing to please others, but whenever he prepares to punish her by letting her worry about him for a change, Fancy apologizes for her vanity. Unable to resist her tears, the young lover takes her back into his heart before she knows there has been a problem.On the day Dick is at last to meet Fancy\u2019s father to ask for her hand, Dick prepares himself carefully. Fancy\u2019s father tells him bluntly that he is not good enough for Fancy and that she is too cultured, too well educated, and too wealthy for a plain carrier. Sadly, Dick agrees, and he turns toward home.Fancy, however, is not so easily defeated. When tears fail to move her father, she resorts to the age-old trick of languishing away for love. She does not eat, at least not so that her father notices; she merely pines and sighs. The ruse works, and her father reluctantly finds himself begging her to marry her young lover. The date is set for the coming midsummer.On the day Fancy is installed at the organ and the choir is discontinued, Dick can not attend church because he has to serve at the funeral of a friend. Fancy has put her hair in curls and in other ways dresses more lavishly than usual. Dick is sorry to see her dress so beautifully, especially given that she knows he will not be present to see her. Still, she puts him off brusquely. On his way home that night, Dick walks through the rain to get one last glimpse of his love before he retires for the night. She refuses to lean far enough out her window to give him a kiss. Later, when she sees Vicar Maybold approaching through the rain, she greets him warmly. The vicar, who had been enchanted with her appearance that morning and knows nothing of her betrothal to Dick, has decided to ask for her hand in marriage. Surprising even herself, Fancy accepts him.The next morning, Maybold meets Dick on the road. Still thinking himself betrothed, Dick shyly tells Maybold of his coming marriage to Fancy. Shocked, Maybold keeps silent, leaving Dick ignorant of Fancy\u2019s faithlessness. Maybold then sends a note to the young lady, telling her that she must not forsake Dick. Before his note can be delivered, Maybold receives a note from Fancy, in which she writes that she had been momentarily swayed by the prospect of a more cultured, elegant life; she begs to withdraw her acceptance of his proposal because she has loved and still loves another.The wedding takes place that summer. It is a great celebration, marred only by Maybold\u2019s refusal to perform the ceremony. Dick is puzzled and cannot think of any way in which he might have offended the vicar. After the ceremony, Dick tells his bride that they will never have a secret between them; Fancy replies that they never will, beginning from that day forth.", "author": "Thomas Hardy"},

Lamuse, the ox man, is puffy around the eyes; he had been on fatigue duty during the night.Three breathless fatigue men bring up the breakfast. One of the squad, Paradis, asks what is in the cans. When the mess man merely shrugs, Paradis looks in the cans and sees that they hold kidney beans in oil, bully beef, pudding, and coffee.One man explains to his neighbor the arrangement of the trenches, for he has seen a military map and has made calculations. There are more than six thousand miles of trenches on the French side and as many more on the German side. The French front is only an eighth of the total world front. Just to think about it makes one feel more insignificant, and it is terrible to imagine so much mud. The only possible way to look at the whole matter is to concentrate on dislodging the Germans in the opposite lines.One man, a private, once saw a captured Prussian colonel who was being led along the communication trench. When the private kicked him, the officer nearly had a seizure to think that a subordinate had touched him. The squad agrees that the German officers are the real evil.There is a disturbance just ahead; several important people are coming to visit. From their oaths and grunts, it is clear that they are civilians. One of the visitors is so bold as to ask whether the coffee is good. The squad remembers the saying that a war can be won if the civilians can hold out.When the mail comes, rumors fly fast. Many are sure that their squad is soon to be sent to the Riviera for a long rest; one man has heard that they are going to Egypt. The troops stop gossiping when a company of African soldiers moves by; they conclude that an attack has been planned, for the Africans are notoriously ferocious fighters.During a sharp attack, both of Volpatte\u2019s ears are almost severed. At the dressing station, the doctors bandage his head. Volpatte is happy to be going to the rear, where at last he will be able to rest. After a long while, he returns to the trenches with his ears nicely sewed. When his comrades ask him about the hospital, he becomes so angry he can scarcely speak. Then it all comes out: The hospital is swarming with malcontents, malingerers, and general shirkers. The worst are those assigned to the hospital for duty; they seem to think they run the whole war. The squad soothes Volpatte, saying, let those who can, get by easily.When the squad retires for a brief rest, they are billeted in a village where, for an outrageous sum, they rent a cowshed without walls. They use a door set up on boxes as a table and a plank as a bench, but they find it a wonderful experience to be aboveground once more. The woman who runs the house sells them wine for twenty-two sous, although the established price is fifteen sous a bottle. Everywhere they go they hear the same story: The civilians are enduring all the hardships.Eudore gets a fourteen-day leave. His wife, a practical person, has applied well in advance for a permit to go to the village of her husband\u2019s people. She runs a tiny inn with only one room, where she would have no privacy to entertain her man, whereas Eudore\u2019s people have a big house. Eudore arrives in his village after much delay with only seven days left of his furlough, but his wife is not there; her permit has not arrived. Fearing that he will miss her, he stays with his parents and waits. Then she writes to say that no permits are allowed for civilian travel. Eudore goes to the mayor and gets permission to go to his wife. It is raining very hard when he gets off the train to walk the several additional miles to his home. On the way, he falls in with four other soldiers returning from leave. They tramp along together in the rain until they come to the inn. Eudore and his wife cannot turn the four soldiers out in the rain, and so all six of them spend the night sitting in chairs in the tiny room. Early in the morning Eudore must leave, as his furlough is over.Fraternization with the enemy is strictly forbidden. While out looking for bodies, Poterloo takes a chance and falls in with some German privates, jolly fellows who offer to go with Poterloo to a nearby Alsatian village so that he can see his wife. Poterloo puts on some great boots and a German coat and follows his new friends behind the German lines. They reach the village safely, and that night, Poterloo walks twice past the house where his wife is staying with relatives. Through the lighted window, he can see his wife and her sister at dinner with a group of German noncommissioned officers. They are eating well and enjoying themselves. Poterloo carries back to the trenches a disheartening image in his mind: his wife laughing up into the face of a German sergeant.Of the six Mesnil brothers, four have been killed by 1915, and the survivors, Joseph and Andr\u00e9, have been pessimistic about their own chances. On reconnaissance, one of Bertrand\u2019s squad discovers Andr\u00e9, dead, propped upright in a shell crater. At first they are afraid to tell Joseph, but when they tell him he does not seem much affected by the news. Bertrand is killed, and Joseph is wounded in the leg. He is taken to the dismal dressing station, a large dugout. There are many men in the dugout, most of them resigned to death, all of them given to spiritless discussion. They agree that to stop war, one has to kill the spirit of war, and that appears to be a difficult job. It comes as a new thought to some of them that they are the masses, and the masses have the power to stop war, but it is too big a job. Many men think only in terms of killing the enemy. It hardly matters anyway, as nearly all of them will be dead soon. The war goes on.", "author": "Henri Barbusse"},
{"title": "Uncle Vanya", "summary": "\u00a0 Astrov, the doctor, calls to attend the retired Professor Serebryakov, who complained all night of pains in his legs. To the doctor\u2019s annoyance, the professor leaves for a long walk with his wife, Yelena, and his daughter, Sonya. Astrov tells the old nurse, Marina, that he is so overworked he feels a hundred years old. He also feels that, having worked with weak, discontented people for years, he became as strange as they. Caring for nothing and no one, he wonders if people living a hundred years hence will remember men like him who struggled to beat out the road for them.\u00a0Marina explains that the professor completely changed the routine of the house, so that everyone waits on him and routine work is fitted in where possible. Ivan Voynitsky enviously describes the fortunate life the professor has. The professor lives on the estate of his first wife, whose mother dotes on his every word. He is retired now and writing as he pleases; he has a new and beautiful young wife to cater to him. It is, however, Ivan, Sonya\u2019s Uncle Vanya, who blindly follows his mother\u2019s ideals and makes the estate a splendidly productive place that can supply all the professor\u2019s needs. Only recently did Ivan realize how selfish the professor is. Ivan tells his mother that he can no longer bear to hear of the pamphlets that were her life for the last fifty years.When the professor comes in, he immediately excuses himself to return to his writing. Yelena, apologizing to the doctor, says that her husband is well again. Both Ivan and the doctor admire her extravagantly, and the doctor invites her and Sonya to come to his estate to see his trees. A crank on the subject of trees, the doctor wants to restore the countryside to its state before the peasants indiscriminately cut down the forests. Yelena realizes Sonya is attracted to the doctor. Yelena is bored with everything, even Ivan\u2019s love for her.When the professor again complains of pains in his legs, he keeps his wife awake for two nights. Believing that he earned the right to be disagreeable and tyrannical at his age, and feeling that he is in a vault with stupid people who make foolish conversation, he refuses to see the doctor he summoned. He begs not to be left with Ivan, who will talk him to death. Only Marina seems to be able to handle him; she leads him away so that the others can rest.Yelena asks Ivan to try to reconcile everyone. When Ivan declares his love to her again, she leaves him. Ivan realizes he could have fallen in love with her ten years before and might even have married her if he had not been wrapped up in the ideal of fulfilling the professor\u2019s wishes. He feels cheated in the realization that the retired professor is a nonentity.Ivan and the doctor continue the drinking they start while the doctor waits to see the professor. Sonya asks them both to stop, Ivan because he is living on illusions, the doctor because she does not want him to destroy himself. She tries to tell him obliquely that she loves him, but he feels that his reactions are blunted. He will never be able to love anyone, though Yelena might be able to turn his head.Yelena and Sonya effect a reconciliation when Yelena explains that she married Sonya\u2019s father in the belief that she loved him, only to find she was in love with an ideal. Having lost that illusion, she finds herself very unhappy. Sonya, glad to make friends with her, is happy about everything; she speaks at last to the doctor, even if he does not understand her.While waiting for the hour at which the professor asks all the family to join him, Yelena complains of being bored. Sonya suggests that she help on the estate. When Yelena declines all suggestions, Ivan tells her she is too indolent to do anything. To make matters worse, her indolence is catching, for he stopped work to follow her, as did Sonya and the doctor, who used to come once a month but now comes daily. Since Yelena seems to have mermaid blood in her veins, he says, she should let herself go for once and fall in love with a water sprite. Yelena is indignant. Ivan, as a peace offering, goes to get her some autumn roses.Sonya asks Yelena\u2019s help. She knows the doctor comes to see Yelena, not even realizing Sonya is there. Yelena decides to speak to him in Sonya\u2019s behalf. When she does, he laughs at her for pretending she does not know why he comes. Then he kisses her. Yelena halfheartedly holds him off until she sees Ivan returning with the roses.The professor, not content with country living but unable to live in the city on the income from the estate, suggests that they sell the estate, invest most of the money, and buy a small place in Finland with the remainder. His plan is greeted with horror, particularly by Ivan, who is driven almost mad as he feels the estate slipping away from Sonya, the work of twenty-five years undone. He explains how the estate was bought for Sonya\u2019s mother and handed on to Sonya; how he paid off the mortgage and made the place productive; how Sonya and he slaved on the property by day and over books by night with only the professor in mind. Feeling cheated, he rushes away while the professor declares that he can no longer live under the same roof with Ivan. Yelena begs him to leave the place immediately, but to apologize to Ivan before they leave. When the professor tries to make amends, Ivan shoots at him twice, missing both times.Marina, pleased with the arrangement, hopes that matters will settle down after the professor and his wife leave. Astrov refuses to go home before Ivan gives back the morphia he took from the doctor\u2019s bag. Ivan, saying he is a madman, begs for a way out, but the doctor laughs and says that the two of them, the only well-educated men in the district, are swamped in the trivialities of country life and that they are both eccentric, a very normal human condition. After reconciliations all around, the professor and Yelena leave, followed by Astrov. Marina rocks away with satisfaction, Ivan\u2019s mother goes back to her pamphlets, and Sonya assures Ivan that they completed their lives\u2019 work and will find rest in heaven.", "author": "Anton Chekhov"},
{"title": "Uncle Silas", "summary": "\u00a0 Maud Ruthyn spends a lonely childhood in the great old house at Knowl. Her mother dies when she is very young, and her father, Austin Ruthyn, becomes a recluse who seldom leaves the grounds of his estate. Disappointed in Parliament many years earlier, he retires from public life to devote himself to scientific and literary studies. These lead him to Swedenborgianism, a doctrine suited to his eccentric and moral tastes. Maud knows him as a kindly but solitary and taciturn man.\u00a0For this reason, she never questions him about her uncle Silas, her father\u2019s younger brother, who lives at Bartram-Haugh, a Derbyshire estate owned by Austin. His portrait as a handsome young man hangs in the oak room at Knowl, but from vague hints and whispers of the servants, she knows that there is a mystery surrounding this relative whom she never met, and that the scandal clouds her father\u2019s life as well.One of the few visitors at Knowl is Dr. Bryerly, a tall, ungainly man who always dresses in black and wears an untidy scratch wig. Like Maud\u2019s father, he is a Swedenborgian. The girl is greatly in awe of him, but she knows that he has her father\u2019s confidence. One day, Austin shows her the key to a locked cabinet in his study. He is soon to go on a journey, he says, and after his departure she is to give the key to Dr. Bryerly.Maud is a little past seventeen years old when her father employs a new governess, Madame de la Rougierre, a tall, masculine-looking woman with sly, smirking manners. Maud dislikes her from the start. On every possible occasion, the governess questions her charge about Austin\u2019s will and business affairs; sometimes Maud thinks the woman is deliberately spying on the household. One day, Madame de la Rougierre and her pupil walk to a ruined abbey near Knowl, where a strange young man accosts Maud. The girl is frightened by his coarse appearance and offensive manner, but Madame de la Rougierre ignores the incident.Maud forgets the whole affair in her excitement over the arrival of Lady Monica Knollys, her father\u2019s cousin from Derbyshire and a brisk, sensible noblewoman. During the visit, Madame de la Rougierre pretends to be ill, and it turns out that she and Lady Monica knew each other in the past. When Lady Monica tells Austin that the governess is not a suitable companion for his daughter, he accuses her of prejudice, and they have a terrible argument, as a result of which Lady Monica leaves Knowl abruptly. Before leaving, she warns Maud against Madame de la Rougierre and cautions her always to be on guard against her. Lady Monica also tells Maud that at one time her uncle Silas, whom she clearly does not like, was suspected of murder, but that nothing was charged. Later, Silas becomes interested in religion.A short time later, while Maud is walking with Madame de la Rougierre in the park, they see on an unfrequented road a carriage with one woman as its only passenger. They continue on their way and meet three men, among them the coarse young stranger who approached Maud near the ruins of the abbey. All are tipsy and address the governess with rough familiarity. When one of the men tries to seize Maud, her screams attract two gamekeepers. In a scuffle with the intruders, one of the gamekeepers is shot. Austin and the servants try to intercept the strangers at the park gates, but the men and their woman companion disappear.Madame de la Rougierre is given notice not long afterward. One night, Maud falls asleep in her father\u2019s study. She awakens to find the governess going through his private papers. Informed of the midnight search, Austin discharges the woman immediately.When Austin dies suddenly of a heart attack, Maud understands at last to which journey he was referring. She also learns that Dr. Bryerly was her father\u2019s physician as well as his friend. With the key she gives him, the doctor unlocks the cabinet that contains Austin\u2019s will. Its provisions disturb Dr. Bryerly and fill Lady Monica with dismay. After varying bequests to relatives, friends, and servants, the remainder of Austin\u2019s great estate is given to Maud, under the trusteeship of Dr. Bryerly, Lord Ilbury, Sir William Aylmer, and Mr. Penrose Cresswell. Silas Ruthyn is appointed Maud\u2019s guardian, with the stipulation that the girl is to live with him at Bartram-Haugh until her twenty-first birthday. Lady Monica immediately recalls the strange circumstances under which Mr. Charke, a turfman to whom Silas owed large gambling debts, was found dead at Bartram-Haugh; only the fact that the body was discovered in a bedroom locked from the inside kept Silas from being charged with murder. In turn, Dr. Bryerly is disturbed by the knowledge that Silas would inherit her fortune if Maud dies before her majority, and he advises that an attempt be made to have the provisions of the wardship put aside. Silas, however, refuses to relinquish his guardianship. Maud, who interprets the will as her father\u2019s wish that she vindicate her uncle\u2019s name by becoming his ward, announces that she will go to live with Silas in Derbyshire.With her maid, Mary Quince, Maud travels by carriage to Bartram-Haugh, where she finds the house to be old and rambling; many of the rooms are closed and locked, and the grounds are wild and neglected. Although Silas welcomes his niece courteously and with many pious sentiments, it seems to Maud that at times he is secretly laughing at her. His own rooms are furnished in great luxury. The quarters Maud shares with her cousin Milly, however, are shabby and bare. Milly is a loud, good-humored girl at whom her father sneers because of her hoydenish manners. Maud takes an immediate liking to her young relative. There is also a son, Dudley, but Milly says that her brother is seldom at home.When Maud and her cousin go for a walk the next morning, they find the gate leading into Bartram Close locked and guarded by Meg Hawkes, the miller\u2019s rough-tongued daughter, who refuses to let them pass. The girls enter the park by a seldom-traveled path that Milly knows, and there they meet a pleasant young gentleman who introduces himself as Mr. Carysbrook, a tenant at the nearby Grange.Maud\u2019s only companion is Milly, and she sees very little of her uncle, who is addicted to laudanum and passes many of his days in a coma. Sometimes, the girls are summoned to sit in his room while he lies quietly in bed. One day, Dr. Bryerly appears unexpectedly to transact some business with Silas. When the doctor questions her, Maud replies that she is happy at Bartram-Haugh. Dr. Bryerly gives her his address in London and tells her to communicate with him if the need should ever arise.Early in December, Lady Monica opens her house at nearby Elverston and invites Maud and Milly to visit her. Among the guests at dinner is Mr. Carysbrook. Lady Monica tells Maud that he is really Lord Ilbury, one of her trustees.When Maud returns to Bartram-Haugh, she meets Dudley Ruthyn, who is the same vulgar young man she encountered twice before at Knowl. When she mentions those meetings, Silas brushes the matter aside. He declares that the spirits of youth run high at times, but that Dudley is a gentleman. Maud is relieved to learn that Milly dislikes and fears her brother, and the girls avoid him as much as possible. When Meg Hawkes becomes ill, Maud brings her medicines and delicacies and wins the strange girl\u2019s devotion.Lord Ilbury calls at Bartram-Haugh and expresses the hope that Maud will be allowed to visit his sister at the Grange, but Silas refuses his consent. Dr. Bryerly also comes and accuses Silas of misusing his ward\u2019s property. Infuriated, Silas orders him out of the house. A short time later, Milly is sent to study in a French convent. Maud misses her company, but her situation becomes even more unbearable when Dudley begins to persecute her with proposals of marriage. Silas tells her she should consider the matter seriously for a fortnight. Before that time passes, however, Dudley\u2019s unwelcome attentions abruptly end when his secret marriage to Sarah Mangles, a barmaid, is revealed. Sarah is the woman Maud saw in the carriage at Knowl. Silas is furious and sends Dudley and his bride away. Before his departure, Dudley offers to conduct Maud safely to Lady Monica for twenty thousand pounds. Convinced that this is another of his schemes, she refuses. A few days later, she sees in the paper an announcement stating that Dudley and his wife sailed for Melbourne.Silas confesses to his ward that he faces final and complete ruin. To elude his creditors, he will be forced to send Maud to join Milly in France; he himself will travel by another route to join them there. Maud grows apprehensive, however, when she learns that her companion on the journey is to be Madame de la Rougierre, her former governess. Confined like a prisoner, she tries to communicate her plight to Lady Monica, but the servant she bribes to carry her letter returns the message to his master. With reproaches for her ingratitude and accusations against him, Silas tells her that she is to leave for France immediately with Madame de la Rougierre; Mary Quince, the maid, will follow with him in a few days.Guarded by her grim companion, Maud is taken to London and spends the night in an obscure hotel. The next night, they take a train to Dover, so Madame de la Rougierre informs her, but when she awakens the next morning, she finds herself in one of the upper chambers at Bartram-Haugh. Madame de la Rougierre says only that there was a change in plans. Maud realizes that her only hope lies in Meg, who unexpectedly appears.That night, Madame de la Rougierre drinks some drugged wine intended for Maud and falls asleep on the girl\u2019s bed. Crouched in the shadows of an old press, Maud is surprised to see the window of the room swing inward and a man suspended by a rope clamber over the sill. The intruder is Dudley; the announcement of his departure for Australia was another of Silas\u2019s fabrications. Dazed, she sees him raise a spiked hammer and strike at the figure on the bed. When old Silas enters by the doorway and the two begin to open a trunk containing the girl\u2019s jewelry, she takes advantage of the noise and runs from the room. As she leaves the house, she encounters Tom Brice, a servant who is in love with Meg. The man curses his master\u2019s villainy and drives Maud to safety at Elverston.She is so shaken by her experience that Lady Monica hurries her off to France at once, and two years pass before she learns what happened after her flight. Silas killed himself with an overdose of opium; Dudley disappeared; and Madame de la Rougierre\u2019s body was found buried in the courtyard, its whereabouts disclosed by Meg\u2019s old father. Subsequent investigation revealed that Maud\u2019s room was the chamber in which Charke was found dead; the peculiar construction of the window frame explained how his murderer was able to enter a room locked from the inside.Eventually, Milly becomes the wife of a worthy clergyman. Meg marries Brice and the two emigrate with money given them by Maud. Dr. Bryerly gives up his practice and undertakes the management of the Ruthyn estates. Maud marries Lord Ilbury and finds new happiness as a wife and mother.", "author": "Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu"},
{"title": "Ulysses", "summary": "\u00a0 Buck Mulligan mounts the stairs of the old tower and prepares to shave himself on the morning of June 16, 1904. A moment later, Stephen Dedalus comes to the top of the stairs and stands looking out over Dublin Bay. When Mulligan speaks of the sea glinting in the morning sunlight, Stephen has a sudden vision of his own mother; he had been called back from Paris to her deathbed a year before. He remembers how she begged him to pray for her soul and how he, rebelling against the churchly discipline of his boyhood, refused.\u00a0After breakfast, Stephen and Mulligan go off with Haines, a young Englishman who also lives in the old tower. Despite the Englishman\u2019s attempts to be friendly, Stephen dislikes Haines, who is given to nightlong drunken sprees. Stephen feels that his own life is growing purposeless and dissolute through his association with Mulligan and other medical students. Stephen is a teacher. It is a half-day holiday at school, and the boys are restless. One of his pupils is unable to do his simple arithmetic problems, and in the boy Stephen sees for a moment an image of his own awkward youth. He is relieved when he can dismiss the class.Later, Stephen walks alone on the beach. He thinks of literature and his student days, of his unhappiness in Dublin, his lack of money, his family sinking into poverty while his shabby-genteel father makes his daily round of the Dublin pubs. He sees the carcass of a dead dog rolling in the surf and remembers how a dog had frightened him in his childhood. He is, he thinks wryly, not one of the Irish heroes.Meanwhile, Leopold Bloom has crawled out of bed to prepare his wife\u2019s breakfast. He is a Jewish advertising salesman, for sixteen years the patient, uncomplaining husband of Marion \u201cMolly\u201d Tweedy Bloom, a professional singer of mediocre talent. He is unhappy to know that she is carrying on an affair with Blazes Boylan, a sporting Irishman who is managing the concert tour that she is planning. Bloom munches his own breakfast and reads a letter from his daughter Milly, who works in a photographer\u2019s shop in Mullingar. Her letter reminds Bloom of his son Rudy, who died when he was eleven days old. Bloom reads Milly\u2019s letter again, wondering about a young student his daughter mentions. For a moment, he is afraid that Milly might grow up to be like her mother.Bloom sets out on his morning walk. At the post office, he stops to pick up a letter addressed to Henry Flower, Esq., a letter from a woman who signs herself Martha. Bloom, unhappy at home, is carrying on a flirtation by mail under another name. He idly wanders into a church and listens to part of the mass. Later, he joins a party of mourners on their way to the funeral of an old friend, Paddy Dignam, who died suddenly of a stroke. During the service, Bloom watches Father Coffey. He thinks again of little Rudy and of his own father, a suicide. The day\u2019s business for Bloom is a call at a newspaper office to arrange for the printing of an advertisement. While he is there, Stephen Dedalus also arrives at the office. The two men see each other, but they do not speak.Bloom leaves the newspaper building and walks across the O\u2019Connell bridge. He meets Mrs. Breen and gives her an account of Dignam\u2019s funeral. She tells him that Mrs. Purefoy is in the maternity hospital in Holles Street. Bloom walks on, watching the sights of Dublin on a summer day. He enters Davy Byrne\u2019s pub and orders a cheese sandwich. Later, he goes to the National Library to look at some newspaper files. There Stephen, flushed with the drinks he had at lunch, is expounding to Buck Mulligan and some literary friends his own ingenious theory of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays and the second-best bed mentioned in Shakespeare\u2019s will. Again, Bloom and Stephen see each other but do not speak.Bloom goes to the Ormond Hotel for a late lunch. Blazes Boylan comes into the hotel bar before he leaves to keep his appointment with Molly.Late that afternoon, Bloom gets into a brawl in a pub where the talk is all about the money that Blazes Boylan has won in a boxing match. Bloom escapes from the jeering crowd and walks along the Sandymount shore. In the dimming twilight, he watches young Gertie MacDowell. The moon rises. Bloom decides to stop by the hospital to ask about Mrs. Purefoy. As he walks slowly along the strand, a cuckoo clock strikes nine in a priest\u2019s house that he is passing. Bloom considers that he has been cuckolded while he has sat dreaming his amorous fantasies on the Dublin beach, looking at Gertie MacDowell. At the hospital, he learns that Mrs. Purefoy\u2019s baby has not yet been born. There he sees Stephen Dedalus again, drinking with Buck Mulligan and a group of medical students. Bloom is disturbed to find the son of his old friend Simon Dedalus in such ribald, dissolute company.Bloom goes with the medical students to a nearby pub, where Stephen and Buck Mulligan begin a drunken argument over the possession of the key to the old tower. When the group breaks up, Stephen and one of the students go on to a brothel in the Dublin slums; Bloom follows them slowly. All are drunk. Bloom has a distorted, lurid vision of his wife and Blazes Boylan together. Stephen is befuddled and thinks that he sees his dead mother suddenly appearing from the grave to ask him again to pray for her soul. Running headlong into the street, he is knocked down in a scuffle with two British soldiers.Bloom takes Stephen home with him. Exhausted by his wild night, Stephen remains silent and glum while Bloom talks about art and science. Bloom begs him to spend the night, to leave Mulligan and his wild friends and come to live with the Blooms, but Stephen refuses. The bells of St. George\u2019s Church are ringing as he walks off down the silent street.Bloom slowly goes to bed. As he drifts off to sleep, he tells Molly firmly that she is to get up and prepare his breakfast in the morning.Molly Bloom lies awake thinking of Blazes Boylan. She thinks of the mysteries of the human body, of people she has known, of her girlhood at the military post on Gibraltar. She considers the possibility that Stephen Dedalus might come to live with her and her husband. Stephen is a writer \u2014 young, refined, not coarse like Boylan. She hears a far-off, shrill train whistle. She recalls all of her past lovers, Bloom\u2019s courtship, their years together, the rose she wore in her hair the day Bloom asked her to marry him as they stood close under a Moorish arch. Her thoughts flow on, while her Ulysses, Bloom, the far wanderer of a Dublin day, snores in the darkness by her side.", "author": "James Joyce"},
{"title": "Typee", "summary": "\u00a0 The whaler Dolly was long at sea, and the men are discontented and restless when the captain finally gives orders to put in at Nukuheva, one of the Marquesas Islands. This is the chance for which Tom and Toby, two young sailors, are waiting. Even though the natives of the island are known to be cannibals, Tom and Toby desert the ship and flee inland, planning to hide until the Dolly sails. They hope to then sign aboard another ship where they would get better treatment.\u00a0Tom and Toby begin their flight with only a few biscuits for food. On the first night away from the ship, Tom contracts a disease that causes his leg to swell, and he is in much pain. Nevertheless, he and Toby continue. At last, when their food is all gone, they realize that they can stay alive only by giving themselves up to one of the savage tribes that inhabits the island.They discover too late that the natives to whom they surrender themselves are the Typee tribe, the most ferocious cannibals on Nukuheva. Tom and Toby are treated with respect, however, and are given food and comfortable quarters. All the natives come to see the strangers. Mehevi, the chief of the Typees, appoints Kory-Kory as personal servant to Tom. The captives go to live in the home of Tinor, Kory-Kory\u2019s mother. Mehevi has a medicine man examine Tom\u2019s swollen leg, but the native remedies have no effect on the disease.Tom, unable to walk, spends most of his time reclining in the house while Kory-Kory attends to his needs. A beautiful young maiden, Fayaway, is also his constant companion. She, among all the Typees, seems to understand the painful situation of the two captives. Toby convinces the Typees that he should be allowed to return to the main harbor on the island to seek medical aid for Tom. On the trail, he is attacked by hostile warriors from a neighboring tribe, and he returns to the Typees with an ugly head wound.A few days later, Toby discovers a boat offshore. He is allowed to go down by the beach, but Tom is detained in his house. Toby promises to bring medical aid to Tom within three days, but the three days pass without the return of Toby. Tom can learn nothing from the natives; he realizes that now he is the single captive of the Typees. Somewhat recovered, he is allowed to roam almost at will within the country of the Typees, but he is always accompanied by Kory-Kory, and there is no chance for escape.As Tom\u2019s leg improves, he begins to indulge in the pleasures allowed him and to observe the native life with interest. The Typees seem to exist in a perpetual state of happiness, interrupted only by skirmishes with neighboring tribes. One of Tom\u2019s greatest pleasures is to paddle a canoe about a small lake in company with Fayaway. For the privilege of taking Fayaway with him, he has to ask special permission, since entering a canoe is ordinarily taboo for a woman.One day a handsome stranger appears among the Typees bearing news from other parts of the island. He is Marnoo, a taboo man, who is free to go among all the tribes without harm. When Tom learns that Marnoo knows English, he asks the native to help him escape. This Marnoo cannot do for fear of arousing the anger of the Typees.The daily life of the natives is extremely regular. Each morning they bathe and eat breakfast. After the meal, they smoke their pipes. The rest of the morning they spend sleeping, conversing, or doing odd jobs about their houses. The men often spend the afternoon in the large meetinghouse of Mehevi; there they relax and joke in a sort of bachelors\u2019 club. Before the evening meal, they bathe again. After the meal, the young girls entertain the rest with dancing. Everyone retires at an early hour.Tom is present at the Feast of the Calabashes. It seems to have some religious significance, but most of the time is spent in eating and drinking. During the two days of the festival, Tom decides that the natives do not take their religion seriously. They possess many idols not treated with any high degree of respect. The most universal religious observance is that of tattooing; everyone is tattooed upon the face, even the women. The bodies of some of the men are completely covered with intricate designs.Since the men outnumber the women in the tribe, the women often have two or three husbands, but the men never have more than one wife. All in the tribe seem happy with the various aspects of their social organization. Private property is limited to household goods; food is common property. All understand and follow the laws and customs of the tribe; there are never disputes among the Typees.One day, a battle is fought between the Typees and a neighboring tribe. Afterward, the bodies of the dead enemies are taken to the ceremonial feasting place. For the next day or two, Tom is not allowed to leave the vicinity of his house. He suspects that the Typees are making a meal of their dead enemies. Later he discovers the remains of the meal and finds that he is correct, though the Typees deny that they are cannibals.A few days later, Marnoo again appears among the Typees. This time he tells Tom to try to escape by means of the same path by which he left. Tom is unable to leave the village, however, for Kory-Kory keeps close watch on him day and night.Not many days after Marnoo leaves, the Typees excitedly announce the approach of a boat. Tom argues with the natives and finally persuades them to let him go to the beach. He has some difficulty in getting there, since his leg begins to swell again. At the beach, Tom finds a boat from an Australian ship standing just outside the surf. Marnoo tells the Australian captain of Tom\u2019s trouble, and he sends a boat loaded with presents to obtain Tom\u2019s release. The Typees, however, have no wish to release their captive. In desperation, Tom breaks away from the guard placed around him and plunges into the surf. He manages to reach the boat, and the sailors pull away from shore. Thus ends Tom\u2019s captivity among the Typees. His only regret is in leaving the faithful Kory-Kory and the beautiful Fayaway.Many years later Tom again meets Toby and learns from him that he intended to return to the aid of his injured friend, but he was tricked into boarding a vessel that sailed from Nukuheva the following day. It is only long after Toby gave Tom up for lost that the two friends learn of each other\u2019s fate after their separation.", "author": "Herman Melville"},
{"title": "Two Years Before the Mast", "summary": "\u00a0 In August, 1834, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., ships aboard the brig Pilgrim out of Boston for a voyage to California as an ordinary seaman. He hopes that the journey will relieve his eye trouble, and upon his return he plans to reenter Harvard College. Since Dana is a greenhorn, he is forced to bunk in the steerage instead of in the forecastle with the other sailors. At first his duties are confusing, doubly so during the first two days, for he is violently seasick. He soon finds his sea legs, however, and quickly learns shipboard routine: During the day, all of the sailors are kept busy cleaning and repairing the ship, and during the night they take turns standing watch.\u00a0The voyage is uneventful until October, when the Pilgrim passes near the mouth of the River Plate. Here Dana encounters his first real storm at sea. After that, the weather begins to get cold, and the crew prepares to round Cape Horn. The seas there are high, and the crew battles snow and hail. Everyone\u2019s clothing is perpetually wet. By mid-November, the ship rounds the Horn and heads north.The first mishap of the voyage occurs soon after, when a young sailor is swept overboard. A boat lowered to search for him finds no trace of the lost man. In accordance with custom, the captain auctions off the dead man\u2019s clothing. Near the end of November the brig makes the island of Juan Fernandez and drops anchor for the first time since departing from Boston. Dana is glad to see land and manages to get on shore for a short time. As soon as the ship takes on fresh water, however, it weighs anchor and heads on for California.Shortly after Christmas, Dana is acknowledged to be experienced enough to move into the forecastle with the other crew members. Now he is a real seaman. By the middle of January, the Pilgrim makes her first California port at Santa Barbara. Dana learns that his work for the next year will be to load cattle hides into the ship. The sailors carry the stiff, undressed hides out through the surf on their heads and deposit them in a boat, whose crew takes the hides to the ship and stows them away.Once the hides are on board, the Pilgrim takes on some passengers and sails northward to Monterey. There, Mexican customs officers inspect the cargo, after which the company agent aboard the ship sets up a store to trade with the townspeople. The crew is kept busy on a shuttle service between ship and shore. Because he has some knowledge of languages, Dana becomes the interpreter for the Pilgrim and is sent ashore on errands that require a knowledge of Spanish. In this way, he becomes acquainted with the town and its people. He finds the Spaniards to be pleasant but lazy; most of the trade is carried out by foreigners. Everyone owns horses, and they are so plentiful that the price of a fine animal is very low.When business begins to fall off, the Pilgrim returns to Santa Barbara to collect more cattle hides from shore. At that time, trouble begins to brew aboard ship. The captain, mates, and crew are at odds. One day, when the captain begins to flog a sailor unjustly, another of the crew remonstrates, whereupon the captain flogs him, too. The sailors are angry, but they have no higher power to which they can appeal, for the captain\u2019s word is law. Her hold laden with hides, the Pilgrim sails for San Diego.In San Diego, Dana gets his first shore leave. After drinking for a time with the rest of the crew, he and a friend hire horses and ride to a nearby mission, where they are able to get a good Mexican meal, a welcome change from the salt beef served aboard ship.The undressed hides are unloaded from the Pilgrim and placed in a large shed on the beach, where they are to be dressed and stored until a later time. Just when the ship finishes unloading and is ready to set sail, a man deserts ship. After an unsuccessful search, the brig puts to sea without him.The Pilgrim takes on more hides at San Pedro and then continues on to Santa Barbara. It is the Lenten season, and Dana sees the celebrations ashore. The ship gathers more hides at several places and returns to San Diego. After the hides are unloaded, the captain sends Dana and another man ashore to assist with the dressing of the hides. Then the ship sails north on another coastal voyage.Dana becomes acquainted with several Sandwich Islanders who live on the beach and work with him; he finds them to be generous men and true friends. Some of his spare time he spends reading books and studying navigation. Each day, he has to take care of a certain number of hides, which have to be cleaned, soaked in brine, scraped, dried, beaten, and stored away.When the ship Alert arrives at San Diego, Dana, anxious to be at sea again, exchanges places with a boy aboard the ship. The Alert belongs to the same company as the Pilgrim and is to take on the accumulated hides and carry them to Boston. The Pilgrim is not scheduled to return to Boston until later. The two vessels exchange captains, and Dana is under the same master as before, but because the first mate of the Alert is a good officer, Dana finds conditions much more pleasant in his new berth.Loading hides, the Alert moves up and down the coast for several months. In mid-November, 1835, the ship leaves Santa Barbara with some passengers bound for Monterey. When a terrific gale comes up, however, the ship is unable to put in at Monterey and goes on up the coast to San Francisco. The ship continues working up and down the coast until there are enough hides at San Diego to make a full cargo. In May, the Alert heads south for Cape Horn.Rounding the Horn on the return journey is even worse than on the way out. Just when he is needed most on deck, Dana is laid low with a toothache. For days everyone has to work extra hours because of the danger from icebergs. Finally, the Alert gets clear of the ice and runs before a strong wind around Cape Horn.Once the ship enters the Atlantic tropics, the weather is fair except for occasional violent storms. Some of the men begin to come down with the scurvy, but they are cured after the crew obtains fresh vegetables from a passing ship. On September 21, 1836, the Alert anchors in Boston Harbor. Hurriedly the crew performs its last duties in bringing the ship to the wharf. Within five minutes after the last rope is made fast, not one of the crew is left aboard.", "author": "Richard Henry Dana , Jr."},
{"title": "The Two Towers", "summary": "\u00a0 Immediately after Frodo the Ring-bearer and Sam set off to fulfill their quest for the destruction of the Ring of power, a band of orcs captures the two remaining hobbits, Merry and Pippin. In an attempt to defend them, Boromir of Gondor is mortally wounded. Dying, he confesses to Aragorn that he tried to take the Ring from Frodo, who had put on the Ring and vanished to escape him. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli prepare Boromir\u2019s body, place it in an elven boat, and send it over the falls down the Great River. They then follow the tracks of the orcs in an attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin. After several days, they meet a company of Riders of Rohan led by \u00c9omer, the nephew of King Th\u00e9oden, who reports killing the orcs. The Riders of Rohan did not see the hobbits, but they lend horses to the travelers to follow the trail.\u00a0Pippin had tempted an orc to run away with the hobbits for the Ring, which the orc thought was in the hobbits\u2019 possession. When a Rider kills the orc, Pippin and Merry escape in the darkness. They enter the mysterious forest Fangorn, where they meet Treebeard, the leader of the ents, who shelters them. After hearing their story, Treebeard calls an Entmoot to decide what action the ents should take against the forces of evil. On the third day, the treelike ents reach their decision and march on Isengard, the traitor Saruman\u2019s stronghold.After the three hunters find hopeful signs that their friends have escaped the orcs, they enter Fangorn. There they meet Gandalf, who has returned from the depths with new power as the result of his ordeal. He calls to Shadowfax, the great horse borrowed from Rohan\u2019s king, and the four ride toward Th\u00e9oden\u2019s hall. Th\u00e9oden, who is bent with age, greets Gandalf inhospitably. His pale, wizened minister Wormtongue, who nourishes the king\u2019s infirmities, sits at Th\u00e9oden\u2019s feet and vilifies Gandalf until Gandalf raises his staff, lightning flashes, and Wormtongue is sprawled on the floor. Gandalf leads Th\u00e9oden from the shadowy hall, and the old king stands erect and returns to manhood. He announces his determination to lead his people against Saruman. To Wormtongue, whose treachery Gandalf has exposed, he offers a choice: Ride into battle against Saruman or accept banishment. Wormtongue spits and rides away to join Saruman. Th\u00e9oden leaves his niece \u00c9owyn to act as regent in his absence, and Gandalf departs on a secret mission.The battle of Helm\u2019s Deep is fought with great odds favoring Saruman\u2019s orcs and wild hillmen. \u00c9omer and Aragorn perform heroic deeds, and Gimli and Legolas compete to see which of them can kill more orcs. With the morning, a strange forest appears on the hills. Th\u00e9oden leads a gallant charge, and Gandalf returns as the White Rider, striking terror into the enemy. The orcs flee into the forest, but not one comes out.After the battle, Gandalf leads Th\u00e9oden and others to Isengard for a parley with Saruman. On the way, they see several ents, and during the night the strange forest strides past them. Arriving at Isengard, they find devastation. The walls are torn down, and the stronghold itself is filled with steaming water; only the ancient impregnable tower, Orthanc, remains undamaged. Seated at the ruined gates are Merry and Pippin. Merry welcomes them in the name of Treebeard and informs them that Saruman is closeted with Wormtongue in Orthanc. The hobbits tell how the ents attacked Isengard, destroyed its walls with their rootlike hands, and diverted the river waters through Saruman\u2019s underground domain. Then, to their amazement, Gandalf arrived and asked Treebeard for help against the orcs, and the walking forest moved off toward Helm\u2019s Deep. Finally, Wormtongue arrived. Treebeard gave him the choice of joining Saruman or waiting for Th\u00e9oden and Gandalf; he had chosen Saruman.Gandalf calls Saruman to the window of Orthanc. The corrupted wizard tries to sway them with his persuasive voice, but this attempt at enchantment fails, and Gandalf offers him freedom to join them against Sauron or to go to Mordor. He refuses to leave Orthanc and turns away, but Gandalf calls him back, casts him from the White Council, and breaks his staff. As Saruman crawls away, Wormtongue flings a heavy crystal ball at Gandalf. It misses its target and Pippin picks it up, but Gandalf quickly retrieves it. The company leaves the ents to keep Saruman from escaping and rides back toward Th\u00e9oden\u2019s hall. Pippin slips the crystal ball away from Gandalf and looks into it. His eye is drawn to the Dark Tower in the crystal, and, confronted by Sauron, he loses consciousness. Gandalf revives him and learns that Sauron had failed to question him about the Ring.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are traveling through barren country, trailed by Gollum. They waylay him but spare his life, and he swears by the Ring to serve Frodo loyally. From this point, he becomes their guide, leading them toward Mordor. During their journey, Ringwraiths sometimes pass overhead, striking terror into their hearts. As they draw nearer to Mordor, the Ring grows heavier, and Frodo feels the constant probing of Sauron\u2019s evil Eye. They enter Ithilien, a wooded land with flowing streams. Frodo and Sam are captured by men of Gondor led by Faramir, the son of Denethor and brother of Boromir; Faramir tells the hobbits that he has seen Boromir\u2019s body floating in an elven boat. In a rock chamber behind a waterfall, he questions them and learns more about their errand than they intend to divulge; he promises help and gives them provisions. He spares the life of Gollum at Frodo\u2019s entreaty, leads them back to the forest, and sends them on their way.Gollum leads them toward the tower of Minas Morgul, from which an army marches out led by the chief Ringwraith, who stops as if drawn by the power of the Ring but then marches on. Gollum slips away. When he returns and finds Frodo and Sam asleep, a good impulse almost redeems him, but the evil light comes back into his eyes. He leads the hobbits far into a climbing tunnel and there deserts them. They hear a bubbling noise, and Frodo holds up the glass given him by Galadriel, the Elf-Queen. In its piercing light appears Shelob, a huge spidery monster. Blinded temporarily by the light, she retreats. The end of the tunnel is blocked by her web, but Frodo cuts through the cords with his elven sword, Sting, and runs outside. Sam sees that Shelob has used another exit and is pursuing Frodo. As he shouts a warning, Gollum leaps on Sam\u2019s back. Driving Gollum off, he turns back to see Shelob winding Frodo in cords. He snatches up Sting and attacks her. As she flings her foul body on him, he holds Sting so that she wounds herself. In agony, she drags herself back to her hole, leaving a trail of slime.Finding no sign of life in Frodo, Sam decides that he must try to complete the quest alone. When he hears orc voices, he puts on the Ring and vanishes. The orcs discover Frodo\u2019s body and carry it toward the tower. Sam learns from their talk that Frodo is not dead but only stunned. Frodo is alive and a captive, and Sam is locked outside.", "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien"},
{"title": "The Turn of the Screw", "summary": "\u00a0 It is a pleasant afternoon in June when the governess first arrives at the country estate at Bly, where she is to take charge of Miles, age ten, and Flora, eight. She faces her new position with some trepidation because of the unusual circumstances of her situation. The two children are to be under her complete care, and their uncle, who engaged her, has been explicit in stating that he does not wish to be bothered with his orphaned niece and nephew. Her uneasiness disappears, however, when she sees her charges, for Flora and Miles seem incapable of giving the slightest trouble.\u00a0The weeks of June pass uneventfully. Then, one evening, while she is walking in the garden at twilight, the governess is startled to see a strange young man at a distance. The man looks at her in a manner that suggests a challenge and then disappears. The incident angers and distresses the young woman; she decides that the man is a trespasser.On the following Sunday evening, the governess is again startled to see the same stranger looking in at her through a window. He stares piercingly at her for a few seconds and then disappears. This time the governess realizes that the man had been looking for someone in particular, and she thinks that perhaps he bodes evil for the children in her care. A few minutes later, the governess tells the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, of the incident and describes the appearance of the man. Mrs. Grose tells her that it is a perfect description of Peter Quint, the valet to the governess\u2019s employer \u2014 but Mr. Quint is dead.One afternoon shortly afterward, a second apparition appears. This time Miss Jessel, the former governess, appears in the garden to both the governess and the little girl, Flora. The strange part of the situation is that the little girl refuses to admit to the governess that she sees the figure and knows who it is, though it is obvious that she understands the appearance fully.The governess learns from the housekeeper that Quint and Miss Jessel had been lovers while alive, though the young woman came from a very fine family and the man had been guilty of drunkenness and worse vices. For what evil purpose these two spirits wish to influence the seemingly innocent children, neither the housekeeper nor the governess can guess.The secrecy of the children about seeing the ghosts is maddening to the two women. They both feel that the boy is continuing to see the two ghosts in private and conceals that fact, just as he had known of the illicit affair between the valet and the former governess in life and had helped them to conceal it. Yet, when in the presence of the children, the governess sometimes feels that it would be impossible for the two children to be influenced into evil.The third time the ghost of Quint appears to the governess is inside the house. Unable to sleep, she is reading late at night when she hears someone on the stairs. She goes to investigate and sees the ghost, which disappears when faced by her unflinching gaze. Each night after that, she inspects the stairs, but she never again sees the ghost of the man. Once, she glimpses the apparition of Miss Jessel sitting dejectedly on the lowest stair.Worse than the appearance of the ghosts is the discovery that the children have been leaving their beds at night to wander on the lawn in communication with the spirits, who are leading them to unknown evil. It becomes apparent to the governess that the children are not good within themselves. In their imaginations, they are living in a world populated by the evil dead restored.In such an atmosphere, the summer wears away into autumn. In all this time, the children give no sign of awareness of the apparitions. Knowing that her influence with the children is as tenuous as a thread that is likely break at the least stress, the governess does not allude to the ghosts. She herself sees no more manifestations, but she often guesses from the children\u2019s attitudes that the apparitions are close at hand. What is worse for the distressed woman is the thought that what Miles and Flora are seeing are things still more terrible than she imagines, visions that sprang from their association with the evil figures in the past.One day, Miles comes to the governess and announces his desire to go away to school. She realizes that it is only proper that he be sent to school, but she fears the results of ghostly influences on the boy once he is beyond her care. Later, opening the door of the schoolroom, she again sees the ghost of her predecessor, Miss Jessel. As the apparition fades, the governess realizes that her duty is to stay with the children and combat the spirits and their deadly influence. She decides to write immediately to the children\u2019s uncle, breaking his injunction against being bothered in their behalf. That night before she writes, she goes into Miles\u2019s room and asks the boy to let her help him in his secret troubles. Suddenly a rush of cold air fills the room, as if the window had been blown open. When the governess relights the candle blown out by the draft, the window is still closed, and the drawn curtain has not been disturbed.The following day, Flora is briefly missing. Mrs. Grose and the governess find her beside the garden pond, and the governess, knowing that the girl had gone there to see the ghost, asks her where Miss Jessel is. The child replies that she only wants to be left alone. The governess can see the apparition of Miss Jessel standing on the opposite side of the pond. The governess, afraid that the evil influence is already dominating the little girl, asks the housekeeper to take Flora to London to request the uncle\u2019s aid. In place of the lovable, angelic Flora there has suddenly appeared a little child with a filthy mind and filthy speech, which she uses in denouncing the governess to the housekeeper. That same afternoon, Mrs. Grose leaves with the child as the governess has requested.That evening, immediately after dinner, the governess asks Miles to tell her what is on his mind before he leaves the dining room. When he refuses, she asks him if he stole the letter she had written to his uncle. As she asks the question, she realizes that standing outside the window, staring into the room, is the ghost of Peter Quint. She pulls the boy close to her, shielding him from any view of the ghost at the window, while he tells her that he did take the letter. He also informs her that he has already been expelled from one school because of his lewd speech and actions. Noting how close the governess is holding him, he suddenly asks if Miss Jessel is near. The governess, angry and distraught, shrieks at him that the ghost of Peter Quint is just outside the window. When Miles turns around, the apparition is gone. With a scream, he falls into the governess\u2019s arms. At first, she does not realize that she has lost him forever \u2014 that Miles is dead.", "author": "Henry James"},
{"title": "Trout Fishing in America", "summary": "\u00a0Trout Fishing in America begins with a description of the book\u2019s cover photograph, a picture of Brautigan and his wife, Virginia \u201cGinny\u201d Adler, in front of the statue of Benjamin Franklin in San Francisco\u2019s Washington Square. The poor gather there around five in the afternoon to eat sandwiches given to them by the church across the street. One of the narrator\u2019s friends once unwrapped his sandwich to find only a leaf of spinach inside.\u00a0The first time the narrator had heard about trout fishing in America was from a drunken stepfather, and, as a child in Portland, Oregon, he once walked to a street corner and saw a waterfall pouring down from a hill. The next morning, ready to go trout fishing for the first time, he returned to find that the waterfall was only a pair of wooden stairs leading up to a house. Seventeen years later, an actual fisherman, he tried to hitch a ride to go fishing, but no car would pick him up \u2014 another disappointment.Another childhood memory involves the Kool-Aid Wino, a friend who, because of an injury, had to stay home all day. Together, the narrator and the Wino bought grape Kool-Aid and ceremoniously made an entire gallon of it from a nickel package. Ready for a day\u2019s drinking, they created their own Kool-Aid reality. Recipes for apple compote, pie crust, \u201cspoonful\u201d pudding, and walnut catsup lead to memories of Mooresville, Indiana, the home of the John Dillinger Museum, where a Mooresville resident once discovered a basement full of rats and, Dillinger-like, bought a revolver to get rid of them. The narrator\u2019s memories continue to move back and forth from early recollections to recent ones, and from urban memories to outdoor ones.In San Francisco (a \u201cWalden Pond for Winos\u201d), the narrator and his friends, unemployed artists, talk of opening a flea circus or committing themselves to a mental asylum, where it would be warm and they would have clean clothes, hot meals, and pretty nurses. At Tom Martin Creek, Graveyard Creek, and other fishing places, the narrator equally fails to find satisfaction, fighting brush, poison oak, and narrow canyons to fish. Back in San Francisco, the narrator fantasizes about making love in a bookstore to a woman whose husband owns 3,859 Rolls-Royces. Fishing in Hayman Creek, Owl Snuff Creek, and elsewhere catching great trout equally proves to be a fantasy.In San Francisco again, the narrator sees Trout Fishing in America Shorty, a legless, screaming middle-aged wino who trundles about in a wheelchair in the North Beach area. When not passed out in the window of a Filipino Laundromat, Shorty wheels through the streets shouting obscenities in fake Italian (\u201cTra-la-la-la-la-la-Spa-ghet-tiii!\u201d). One day, Shorty passes out in Washington Square in front of the statue of Ben Franklin, and the narrator and a friend think they should crate him up and ship him to American author Nelson Algren, for Shorty is like an Algren character in the books The Neon Wilderness (1947) and A Walk on the Wild Side (1956). They never get around to shipping Shorty and they soon lose track of him, but Shorty should someday be buried, the narrator concludes, beside the Franklin statue, as he and Franklin are both symbols of America. The narrator fantasizes another symbol of America, the Mayor of the Twentieth Century. Wearing mountains on his elbows and blue jays on his shirt collar, the Mayor is a modern Jack the Ripper, performing deeds of murder at night with a razor, a knife, and a ukelele, the last of these an instrument not even Scotland Yard would suspect.The narrator continues to fish for trout in places such as Paradise Creek, Salt Creek, Spirit Prison, Duck Lake, and Little Redfish Lake, but he catches very little. He is reminded of a time in Gelatao in southern Mexico when, cleaning an attic for an elderly lady, he came across the trout-fishing diary kept by the lady\u2019s brother. It contained a ledger calculating the number of trout he had lost over a seven-year period, more than two thousand.In another fantasy, at the Cleveland Wrecking Company the narrator inquires about a used trout stream, plus all accessories, for sale at a bargain price. Everything is for sale: land, disassembled waterfalls, trout streams, trees and bushes, animals, birds and insects. He envisions Leonardo da Vinci, on the payroll of the South Bend Tackle Company, inventing a new spinning lure for trout fishing called \u201cThe Last Supper.\u201d Living, like the Kool-Aid Wino, on invented reality, the narrator takes up residence in a rented cabin above Mill Valley, California, and for no particular reason other than that he had always wanted to, ends his trout-fishing narrative with the word \u201cmayonnaise.\u201d", "author": "Richard Brautigan"},
{"title": "Troilus and Cressida", "summary": "\u00a0 During the Trojan War, Troilus, younger son of Priam, king of Troy, falls in love with the lovely and unapproachable Cressida, daughter of Calchas, a Trojan priest who went over to the side of the Greeks. Troilus, frustrated by his unrequited love, declares to Pandarus, a Trojan lord and uncle of Cressida, that he will refrain from fighting the Greeks as long as there is such turmoil in his heart. Pandarus adds to Troilus\u2019s misery by praising the incomparable beauty of Cressida; Troilus impatiently chides Pandarus, who answers that for all it matters to him Cressida can join her father in the Greek camp.\u00a0Later, Pandarus overhears Cressida and her servant discussing Hector\u2019s anger at receiving a blow in battle from Ajax, a mighty Greek warrior of Trojan blood. Pandarus extols Troilus\u2019s virtues to Cressida, who is all but indifferent. As the two discourse, the Trojan forces return from the field. Pandarus praises several Trojan warriors \u2014 Aeneas, Antenor, Hector, Paris, Helenus \u2014 as they pass by Cressida\u2019s window, all the while anticipating, for Cressida\u2019s benefit, the passing of young Troilus. When the prince passes, Pandarus is lavish in his praise, but Cressida appears to be bored. As Pandarus leaves her to join Troilus, Cressida soliloquizes that she is charmed, indeed, by Troilus, but that she is in no haste to reveal the state of her affections.In the Greek camp, meanwhile, Agamemnon, commander of the Greek forces in Ilium, tries to put heart into his demoralized leaders. Old Nestor declares that the seven difficult years of the siege of Troy are a real test of Greek stamina. It is the belief of Ulysses that the difficulties of the Greeks lie in a lack of order and discipline, not in Trojan strength. He reminds his fellow Greek leaders that the disaffection of mighty Achilles and the scurrilous clowning of Patroclus, a Greek leader, provoke disorder in the Greek ranks. Even Ajax, usually dependable, is fractious, and his follower, deformed Thersites, embarrasses the Greeks with his taunts.As the Greek leaders confer, Aeneas delivers to them a challenge from Hector, who in single combat will defend the beauty and the virtue of his lady against a Greek champion. When the leaders go their several ways to announce the challenge to Achilles and to other Greeks, Ulysses and Nestor decide that the only politic action to take, the pride of Achilles being what it is, is to arrange somehow that Ajax be chosen to fight Hector. Ajax, Achilles, and Patroclus hear of the proclamation but tend to disregard it. Their levity causes the railing Thersites to break with them.In Troy, meanwhile, Hector is tempted to concede to a Greek offer to end hostilities if the Trojans return Helen to her husband, King Menelaus. Troilus chides his brother and Helenus for their momentary want of resolution. As the brothers and their father, Priam, discuss the reasons for and against continuing the war, Cassandra, prophet and daughter of Priam, predicts that Troy will be burned to the ground by the Greeks. Hector heeds her warning, but Troilus, joined by Paris, persists in the belief that the war, for the sake of honor, must be continued. Hector, although aware of the evil the Trojans are committing in defending Paris\u2019s indefensible theft of Helen from her husband, concedes that for reasons of honor the fighting must continue.The Greek leaders approach Achilles, who keeps to himself since his quarrel with Agamemnon. Refusing to confer with them, Achilles retires into his tent and sends his companion, Patroclus, to make his apologies. Achilles persists in refusing to deal with the Greek commanders, who seek in him their champion against Hector. Ulysses plays on the pride of Ajax with subtle flattery and convinces this Greek of Trojan blood that he should present himself as the Greek champion in place of Achilles.In the meantime, Pandarus prepares the way for a tryst between Troilus and Cressida by securing the promise of Paris and Helen to make excuses for Troilus\u2019s absence. He brings the two young people together in his orchard, where the pair confess to each other their undying love. Cressida declares that if she is ever false, then all falsehood will forever afterward be associated with her name. Pandarus witnesses these sincere avowals of faith and himself declares that if Troilus and Cressida do not remain faithful to each other, then all go-betweens will be associated with his name. These declarations being made, Pandarus leads the young people to a bedchamber in his house.In the Greek camp, Calchas, Cressida\u2019s father, persuades Agamemnon to exchange Antenor, a Trojan prisoner, for Cressida, whose presence he desires. Diomedes, a Greek commander, is appointed to effect the exchange. Planning to ignore Achilles, the Greek leaders pass the warrior with only the briefest recognition. When he demands an explanation of that treatment, Ulysses tells him that fame is ephemeral and that great deeds are soon forgotten. Fearful for his reputation now that Ajax has been appointed Greek champion, Achilles arranges to play host to the unarmed Hector after the contest.Diomedes returns Antenor to Troy, and, at dawn, he is taken to Pandarus\u2019s house to escort Cressida to the Greek camp. When Troilus and Cressida learn of Diomedes\u2019 mission, Troilus appeals unsuccessfully to the Trojan leaders to allow Cressida to remain in Troy. Heartbroken, he returns to Cressida and the young couple repeat their vows in their farewells. Troilus then escorts Cressida and Diomedes, who comments on Cressida\u2019s beauty, as far as the city gates. When Diomedes and Cressida encounter the Greek leaders outside the walls, Cressida is kissed by Agamemnon, Menelaus, Nestor, Patroclus, and others. Ulysses observes that she appears wanton.Warriors of both sides assemble to watch Hector and Ajax fight. The two companions clash for only a moment before Hector desists, declaring that he cannot harm Ajax, his cousin. Ajax accepts Hector\u2019s magnanimity and invites the Trojan to join, unarmed, the Greek commanders at dinner. Hector, accompanied by Troilus, is welcomed among the Greeks with many warm compliments, but Achilles, meeting Hector, rudely mentions that part of Hector\u2019s person in which he will one day inflict a mortal wound. Stung by Achilles\u2019 pride and lack of manners, Hector declares hotly that he will destroy all of Achilles at one stroke. The result is an agreement to meet in combat the next day. Ajax manages to calm heated tempers, however, and the feasting begins.Troilus, anxious to see his beloved Cressida, asks Ulysses where he might find Calchas, and Ulysses promises to be his guide. After the banquet, they follow Diomedes to Calchas\u2019s tent, where Cressida meets him and, in affectionate overtures toward Diomedes, reveals to the hidden Troilus that she already has all but forgotten him. As she gives Diomedes, as a token of her love, a sleeve that belongs to Troilus, compunction seizes her for a moment. She quickly succumbs, however, to Diomedes\u2019 charms and promises to be his at their next meeting. Diomedes leaves, vowing to kill in combat the Trojan whose sleeve he will be wearing on his helmet. Troilus, unable to believe that Cressida is the woman he loves so passionately, returns to Troy. He vows to take the life of Diomedes.As the new day approaches, Hector is warned by Andromache, his wife, and by his sister Cassandra not to do battle that day; all portents foretell disaster. When their words prove ineffectual, King Priam tries vainly to persuade Hector to remain within the walls. During the battle, Diomedes unhorses Troilus and sends the horse as a gift to Cressida. Despite his overthrow, Troilus continues to fight heroically. Hector appears to be, for his part, invincible. When Patroclus is severely wounded in the action, Achilles, enraged, orders his followers, the Myrmidons, to stand ready. As the action subsides, and Hector is unarming himself at the end of the day, the Myrmidons, at Achilles\u2019 command, close in on brave Hector and fell him with their spears.Troilus announces to the retiring Trojan forces that Hector was killed by treachery and that his body, tied to the tail of Achilles\u2019 horse, is being dragged around the Phrygian plain. As he makes his way to the gates, he predicts general mourning in Troy and expresses his undying hatred for the Greeks. He encounters Pandarus, whom he abruptly dismisses as a cheap panderer, a man whose name will be infamous forever.", "author": "William Shakespeare"}]
